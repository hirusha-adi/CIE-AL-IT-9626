    -   statistics,
    -   transaction processing
-   Larger and more powerful than personal computers, laptops, or tablets.
-   Cost at least $75,000 in 2020.
-   Originated with large CPUs housed in steel cabinets ("main frame" or "big iron").

## System Software

-   refers to programs that control a computer's hardware and application software.

### Compilers

-   Translate high-level programming languages into machine code (binary form) that the processor can execute.
-   Process:
    -   Translate source code (high-level language) into object code (machine code)
    -   Often requires multiple passes through the program for error checking and resolving references.
    -   Produces a list of error messages **after translation**.
-   Output:
    -   Compiled programs are executable files
    -   that run directly without needing the compiler present
    -   (will sometimes need a runtime environment with all the DLLs (Dynamic Link Libraries) to link to)
-   Languages:
    -   Early examples include FORTRAN, COBOL, and LISP;
    -   modern examples are C++, C#, Visual Basic, Pascal.

### Interpreters

-   Translate and execute high-level language programs one statement at a time.
-   Process:
    -   Converts source code into an intermediate form and executes it immediately.
    -   Stops translation at the first error encountered,
        -   allowing for immediate debugging.
    -   Each statement is translated every time it is executed,
        -   requiring the interpreter to be in memory during execution.
-   Advantages:
    -   Portable between different operating systems.
    -   Useful for program development with immediate execution and error feedback.
    -   Saves memory as only a few lines need to be in memory at a time.
-   Examples:
    -   Python often uses a combination of compilation (to bytecode) and interpretation (via a virtual machine).
    -   Same story with Java, compiled to Java Bytecode and intepreted in Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

                <li>Requires less memory as only parts of the program are loaded at a time.</li>
            </ul>

        <td class="disadvantage">
            <ul>
                <li>More memory-intensive during compilation.</li>
                <li>Error messages are provided after the whole program is compiled, making debugging harder.</li>
                <li>Compiled programs are OS-specific and need recompilation for different systems.</li>
            </ul>
        </td>
        <td class="disadvantage">
            <ul>
                <li>Slower execution as each statement is translated before execution.</li>
                <li>Requires source code to be present at runtime, risking copyright infringement.</li>
                <li>Translation needed every time the program runs, making it less efficient.</li>
            </ul>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

### Linkers

-   Linker is short for 'link editor'
-   Combine object files or modules created by a compiler into a single executable file.
-   Process:
    -   Modules are written separately and then linked together.
    -   Allows large programs to be compiled in smaller parts, conserving RAM.
    -   Object code from different modules is saved on storage and combined later.
-   Advantages:
    -   Facilitates modular programming, reducing memory requirements.
    -   Simplifies error correction as only the faulty module needs fixing.
-   Challenges:
    -   Variable name conflicts.
    -   Requires detailed documentation for module integration.

### Device Drivers

-   Enable the OS and application software to communicate with hardware devices.
-   Role:
    -   Acts as an interface between software and hardware.
    -   Translates software commands into hardware-specific instructions.
-   Importance:
    -   Essential for the operation of hardware devices.
    -   Many drivers are included with the OS for basic functionality.
    -   Specialized features of hardware require specific drivers.
    -   Drivers are OS-specific; a driver for one OS may not work on another.
-   Examples:
    -   Printer drivers,
    -   sound cards,
    -   monitors,
    -   mice,
    -   SSDs,
    -   network cards,
    -   keyboards,
    -   disk drives.

### Operating Systems (OS)

-   Manage computer hardware and software resources, acting as an interface between the user and the computer.

#### Features

-   Memory Management:
    -   Allocates RAM for each program and ensures data integrity.
    -   Prevents data corruption by managing program memory allocation.
-   Input/Output Management:
    -   Handles data input and output via device drivers.
    -   Communicates with input devices and sends data to output devices like printers.
-   File Management:
    -   Manages file storage and retrieval.
    -   Keeps track of file locations and available storage space.
-   Multitasking:
    -   Allocates CPU time to multiple tasks/programs.
    -   Manages task execution to ensure fair resource distribution.
-   Error Handling:
    -   Displays error messages and requires user intervention for resolution.
-   Security:
    -   Manages user login and password encryption.
    -   Controls file permissions and access rights.
-   System Shutdown:
    -   Closes running software safely.
    -   Gradually shuts down the OS and signals the hardware to power off.

#### Boot Process

-   BIOS: Basic Input/Output System stored in ROM, executes during boot-up.
-   OS Loading: Instructions for loading the OS are in ROM; the main OS is loaded from the hard disk.

---

-   Sequence of steps that a computer system goes through when it is powered on or restarted
-   Involves several stages, including hardware checks, loading the BIOS, initializing hardware components, and finally loading the operating system

-   Steps:
    -   Power On
        -   The power supply sends a signal to the motherboard and the processor
    -   POST (Power On Self Test)
        -   The BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) or UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) firmware is activated.
        -   The BIOS performs a POST to check if the essential hardware components (memory, keyboard, storage devices, etc.) are functioning correctly.
        -   If the POST is successful, the BIOS continues the boot process. If not, it generates error messages or beep codes.
    -   Load BIOS/UEFI Settings
        -   The BIOS/UEFI initializes and configures the hardware components.
        -   The BIOS/UEFI settings can be configured by the user to manage hardware configurations and boot priorities.
    -   Locate and Load Boot Loader
        -   The BIOS/UEFI looks for a boot loader in the bootable device (usually specified in the BIOS settings).
        -   The boot loader is a small program that loads the operating system. Common boot loaders include GRUB (for Linux) and Windows Boot Manager.
    -   Load Operating System
        -   The boot loader loads the kernel of the operating system into memory.
        -   The operating system initializes its components, drivers, and services.
    -   Initialize User Interface
        -   Once the OS is fully loaded, it initializes the user interface, allowing the user to interact with the system.
        -   This includes loading the login screen or directly presenting the desktop environment.
