- prosthetics
    - CAD to design perfect fitting stuff
    - CAM to create many prototypes
        - during development
        - for better cusotmization
    - CAM to make more accurate stuff 
    - 3D modelling used during deisgn
    - 3D scanners to quantify areas for implanting
    - use of micro-processor controlled feedback loops
        - to enhance performance
    - connection to nerve by microprocessor
    - `myo-electric` prothetics capture electric signals 
        - through skins
        - to control artificial prosthetic limb
    - microprocessor 
        - to analyse data from sensors
        - send signal to actuator
            -to mimmic natural body movement
    - sensors use synthetic nerve system to detect touch
