## CAM

- prosthetics
    - CAD to design perfect fitting stuff
    - CAM to create many prototypes
        - during development
        - for better cusotmization
    - CAM to make more accurate stuff 
    - 3D modelling used during deisgn
    - 3D scanners to quantify areas for implanting
    - use of micro-processor controlled feedback loops
        - to enhance performance
    - connection to nerve by microprocessor
    - `myo-electric` prothetics capture electric signals 
        - through skins
        - to control artificial prosthetic limb
    - microprocessor 
        - to analyse data from sensors
        - send signal to actuator
            -to mimmic natural body movement
    - sensors use synthetic nerve system to detect touch 

- translation
    - impacts (on scientici research)
        - advantages
            - CAT can increase speed (of translation)
            - available faster for reference
            - more consistent
                - phrases have already been translated before
                - more reliable
            - document format becomes irrelavant
            - readily available
            - technical terms (jargon)
                - retried from the database
                - and translated accurately
                - so, correct context
            - can easily translate to many languages
            - increases collaboration
        - disadvantages
            - contextual erros when new (unseen) content
            - not fully understood by scientist
            - not everything translated correctly
            - so, misunderstanding
            - dialects/localizations not fully translated
            - so, phrases misunderstood
            - repeated translations = loss of accuracy
            - confidentiality lost
                - when comparing with a database

- e-waste
    - impact
        - all components of devices
        - which are discarded
        - might contain harmful chemicals
        - they get into environment
        - eg:
            - lead
            - aluminium
            - cadmium
            - PVC
            - mercury
            - germanium, etc...
        - recycling will hurt the staff/workers (smokes/fumes)
        - CRT monitors release lead
        - when PCBs stripped by burning, dioxins released
        - computer chips release heavy metals when burnt
        - plastics from wires, keyboards, etc...
        - dangerous fumes released to air when burning
        - affects water quality too
        - polutants (eg: heavy metals) get into human food chain
        - need to increase recycling
        - recycle safely to not release dangerous chemicals

- QR codes
    - functional elements
        - positional elements
            - 3 squares at corners to help align camera
            - 1 small square to help camera calibrate size & angle
        - error correction keys stored as dots
        - version info 
            - stored as dots
            - near 'positional elements'
            - to choose decoding algorithm used
        - timing information
            - stored as dots
            - between 'positional elements'
            - to help calibration
        - dots throughout QR to store info in binary form
        - white area around code to seperate code from background
    - why it works if damaged in QR (and not in 1D bar codes)
        - error correction for missing info
        - info. duplicated, so, if one lost, other will work
        - code blocks interleaved with each other
            - less likely to lose data
            - on a localized damage
        - multiple error correction blocks
            - ensure data read from larger QR codes
        - block size limited by design
            - errors corrected quickly
            - by less complex algorithms
        - masking patterns to break up blocks of data
            - (so the processor is not confused)
