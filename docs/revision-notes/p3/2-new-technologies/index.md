## GPS

- how it works
    - GPS recieve sees signals from (at least) 3 satellites
    - satellite transmits their atomic clock time to reciever
    - reciever calculates current time using 3-4 satellites
    - both times are synchronized now
    - reciever uses database of satellite positions
        - updated from satellite signals
    - satellites transmit pseudo random code at set time
    - reciever runs same code & compares code with that from satellite
    - reciever uses difference in **code timing**
        - lag of code
        - to calculate the time it takes
        - signals to travel from satellite to it
    - reciever analyzes 
        - the radio signals to determine distance
        - between 3 satellites
        - calculates position
