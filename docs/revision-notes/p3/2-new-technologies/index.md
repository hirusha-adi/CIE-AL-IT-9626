    - both times are synchronized now
    - reciever uses database of satellite positions
        - updated from satellite signals
    - satellites transmit pseudo random code at set time

## CAT

- computer assisted translation

- advantages

        - retried from the database
        - and translated accurately
        - so, correct context
    - can easily translate to many languages
    - increases collaboration
    - reduce translation time
        - by re-cycling recurring translations
    - reduce need for human input
    - improves performance of human translators
    
- disadvantages

    - not everything translated correctly
    - so, misunderstanding
    - localization might not be perfect
        - dialects/localizations not fully translated
    - so, phrases misunderstood
