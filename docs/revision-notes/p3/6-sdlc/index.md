### RAD

- stages (summarized)
    - determine user reqiurements
    - create early prototypes (function, quickly)
    - gather feedback
    - use it to create high quality feedback
    - reapeat his until software is finished
    - test prototypes throughout development
    - crease user documentation
    - produce final product for rollout to users
- stages
    - requirements phase
        - define project in terms of what needs to be developed
        - gather user requirements
        - define data flow
        - plan processes for managing project
            - eg: risk assestment
        - planning tasks/activities
    - data modelling / requirements phase
        - analyze requirements
        - create sets of data objects
        - define relationships between data objects
        - define test plans
        - define training strategies where required
        - determine implementation method
    - process modelling / user design phase
        - define process for any changes
        - define process for adding a data object
        - users interact with System analysts to develop early prototypes
    - application creation / construction phase
        - making prototypes by experts
        - coding can be automated
        - can code many components simultaneously
        - user evaluvation of prototype
            - repeated testing by users
            - and suggests improvements
    - implementation / cut over phase
        - carrying out test plan by testing data flow
        - testing interfaces between components
        - testing the complete System
        - user training
        - rollout of 'app' to users 
- why (instead of waterfall)
    - project divided to small subtasks
        - (teams can work concurrently)
    - subtasks can make use of specialised teams
    - prototypes created quickly
    - development time is not wasted, 
        - prototype does not work as intended
    - (waterfall method) if project fails, start again 
    - can adapt changes in user requirement
    - can work well when developers telework
    - changes made before final product is created
    - client not surprised by unexpected end product


### Waterfall Model

- phases
    - create requirements
    - analyse to create models / schemes
    - design to create technical designs
    - implementing the code
        - integrating units of code
    - create techinical/user documentation
    - testing (using a test plan)
    - deploy software by 
        - installation
        - migration
        - support
        - maintainance

                    - eg: choices of food
                - when check, attribute set the switch is 'on'
                - only 'on' states submitted with form
            - radio buttons
                - mutually exclusive switches
                - (sharing the same name)

    - why
        - specify criteria for development
        - give guidance for developers
        - specify how System will meet user requirement
        - form part of patent application (for the desing)
        - form basis of accurate costing

- good designs
    - on screen input (form)
        - should be straight forward
            - to reduce misunderstanding
        - consistent
        - simple to use & obvious
        - clear design with enough space
        - keep necessary keystrokes to a minimum to reduce time
        - form should include validation routines
        - use input controls
        - provide immediate feedback
        - appropriate use of white space

## Development

- agile software development
    - for
        - customer satisfaction is highest priority
            - (from early to late stages of development)
        - can easily manage changes in requirement
        - produces working software for client in short period of time
        - devs must work together
        - face-to-face conversation (more efficient)
        - promotes constant pace of development
        - iterative testing, so
            - errors corrected quickly (constant testing)
        - teams are allowed to self-organize
            - leading in better wokring practices
    - against
        - face-to-face daily meetings means must be in same workplace
            - travel costs
        - cost estimates change over time
        - milstones difficult to set
            - uncertain about what they will address in the near future 

## Testing

- strategies
    - alpha testing
        - leads to beta testing
        - stuff
            - usues white box & black box testing
            - by employees
            - uses lab/testing environment
            - takes place under control of developers
            - does reliability testing 
            - does security testing
            - crtical issues fixed immediately
            - gets a more technical analysis report
        - features
            - type of acceptance testing
            - to identify erros before releasing to end users
            - uses both black & white box testing
            - usually work for the software developer
    - beta testing
        - stuff
            - involves black box testing (usually)
            - by third-parties
            - takes place under control of users
        - features
            - done by real end users
            - in real environment
            - final testing phase before release of product
    - other
        - comparisons
            - alpha vs beta
                - similarities
                    - last tests before release
                    - done by other (other than programmers)
                    - impacts final quality of product
        - for open source Operating System
            - ensure writer of test plan knows what he's doing
            - he should be able to
                - define aspects of OS to be tested
                - define test methods
                - use smartphone facilities
                    - assing tasks to ensure smartphone functionality
            - functionality of apps
                - specific / custom written apps
                - third party apps
            - ability to multi-task
            - test if sufficient memmory 
- test case
    - white box testing
    - black box testing
        - advantages
            - easy to use tested
                - dont need to know how it works
                - dont need programming knowledge
            - can walk through app, as a normal user
            - quicker development of test case
                - tester only needs to look at GUI
                - dont need to discover internal routes
                - tests dont from POV of user
                - can expose discrepencies in specification
            - tests can be done by independent personell
                - avoids developer bias
            - test cases can be designed as soon as specification is complete 
        - disadvantages
            - hard to design test cases
                - as no clear test specification
            - difficult script maintainance
            - user interface changing due to testing
            - scripts maybe fragile when working
                - not the same GUI (for different tests)
                - rendering may change
            - doesnt test all internal pathways
            - doesnt fully test software
            - many program paths left untested  
- tester reporting error (report)
    - should have
        - purpose of test
        - how it was carried out
    - special test environment that was created for the test
    - expected reults
    - actual results
    - whether or not the software passes
    - recommendations for testing the software
- test data
    - why
        - to find errors in logic / formulae
        - to show errors in logic formulae
        - confirm validation routines work as expected
        - confirm given input
            - gives expected output 
        - check error handling
            - eg: abnormal inputs 
- test plan
    - importance (new)
        - ensure requirements are met
        - acts as instructors for screen
        - allows management of any changes
            - needed during development
        - defines test to carry out
        - records results of test for later analysis
    - importance (old)
        - overview of all testing
            - Systematic outline of all features
            - continuously checked
        - prepare that all aspects of running a test are considered
        - train those who need to assist with the test
        - mechanism for outlining test needs
            - lists limitations
            - lists reasons for testing
        - Ensures legal issues are met
            - to show regulatory bodies 
            - that testing has been carried out

## Implementation

- pilot running
    - advantages
        - if System fails
            - only one part fails
        - easy to manage implentation at once
            - than a full direct change over
        - staff can be trained in small groups
        - staff can learn from mistakes (made by grouping)
        - trained staff can support training staff
        - only part of company is changed
            - implentation costs can be phased over a longer time period
            - saving company money (large costs at once)
    - disadvantages
        - full implementation takes time
            - eg: direct change over
        - can cause more disruption (to company)
        - IT staff has to support two teams at the same time
            - (unlike direct changeover) 
        - old and new Systems have to interact data
            - so, data is at risk of loss
        - data lost if System fails
- phased implentation
    - question
        - ![alt text](image.png)
        - ![alt text](image-1.png)
    - effectiveness
        - done part by part
        - implementation done in stages
        - time is available for adjustments
        - users have time to adjust
        - technical staff concentrates on one part
        - problems (that arise) at start are less critical
        - training confusin for users
            - used to old System
            - less productive
        - System delivery unclear
            - long duration of change over
            - users workflow disrupted
            - more disruption to bussiness
        - check integrity of data before adding new module
        - 'fall back' to each stage becomes more difficult
        - implementation unclear
            - increases complexity
            - lack of motivation
        - need several adjustments
        - at later stages
            - fall back to old System
            - becomes impossible
            - so, should use half-completed new System


- parallel running (during migration)
    - advantages
        - can compare results (to ensure there's no error)
        - can use existing System
            - while deploying new System
            - so, production is not stopped
        - can use existing System to rectify errors
        - staff can be trained on new System
            - so, staff is confident
    - disadvantages
        - expensive
            - need to pay for two sets of hardware
        - production slows down
            - staff needs to update both Systems at once
            - need to input data twice
            - increases data entry
            - to ensure accurate input to both Systems
        - high maintainance time
            - slow production
            - more expensive

- change over implementation
    - prepare
        - ensure management
            - to determine what needs to be done
            - after change over
        - train staff supports training staff
        - train technicians to maintain new System
        - prepare user manuals
        - ensure data is secure
        - confirm compatibility
        - ensure hardware availability before installation
        - transfer/migrate data from old to new System
        - test new System
    - advantages
        - can change System in convenient time
            - eg: after a shop is closed
        - benefits of new System are available immediately
        - can be carried out quickly
            - with minimal disruptions
    - disadvantages
        - if new System fails, old System is not available now
        - may loose data as old cannot be installed
        - staff has less time to learn System
            - so, maybe more errors

- examples
    - bank replacing their Systems. ensure it carries all the functions. without interruptions.
        - start both Systems at the same time
        - copy everything to the new System
        - new customers register to new System
        - switch all services (after System is installed and running)
        - compare speeds/results
        - long time period to test
        - still keep the old System running
        - ensure everything is duplicated in full
        - no difference to staff or customers
        - after new System tested successfull
        - complete the switch
        - run the old System as a backup (for a short period of time, incase of a sudden failiure)

                - requirements produced first and completed
                - testing at each iteration
                - requirement -> development -> testing -> stop
            - advantages
                - whole System clearly defined and understood
                - early user feedback
                - minor details allowed with time
                - allows additional features to be added
                - builds on a basic foundation
                - divides final product into parts
                - parts developed seperately
                - easy to identify errors
                    - testing and debugging can be done

                - affects functionality of earlier versions
                - may be not all requirements produced
                - high overall costs
        - throw away
            - stuff
                - discarded at any stage
                - produced quickly and cheaply
                - maybe non functional
                - more user involvement
                - easy to measure progress
                - easy to set time-scale
            - reason to use
                - to ensure System requirements are valid
                        - and understoof by all
                - quickest method to obtain feedback
            - disadvantages
                - developers might be pressured to developing unfinished products
                - prototype may not work well
                - lot of time wasted
        - evolutionary
            - stuff
                - becomes a part of the final product
                - developed over time
                - functional from the inception (from start)
            - stuff (compared to throw-off)
                - client may decide that the early version is all that is needed
                - Developers can focus on developing parts of System
                - Instead of developing a whole System which might be beyond their comprehension
                - Improvements to the System can be created later
                - First prototype is not discarded so time is not wasted
                - Throw-away prototypes may not work at all
                - Can be used in interim until final System is complete.

        - comparisons
            - throw away vs evolutionary
                - similarities
                    - develop early prototypes
                    - no full requirement
