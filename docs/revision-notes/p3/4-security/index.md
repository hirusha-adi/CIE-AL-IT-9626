## Encryption

- how to combat cyber crime
    - protects information by scrambling it
    - data cannot be understood without decrypting
    - asymmetric encryption 
        - has two keys
            - public key: available publicly
                - so, no need to send keys
            - private key: not shared
                - no risk of interception
        - used for communications + web
        - secure emails + text messages
    - symmetric encryption
        - to store data on disks
        - cannot be understood if data is stolen
        - protects cloud storage
        - protects data in USB devices
        - prevents use of stolen passwords
            - to protect personal data
            - eg: use in identity theft  


### Symmetric

- advantages
    - same key for encryption + decryption
        - it must be shared
        - 
- disadvantages
    - key must be shared securely
    - confidentiality of keys shared is not gauranteed
    - more secure
        - fixed size block encryption
        - rather than encryption of bits (in asymmetric)
    - simple
        - keys have no special properties 
- to protect data
    - advantages
        - stolen/intercepted data cannot be understood
            - without decryption key
        - data can be sent via insecure networks (eg: public wifi)
            - no issue, since data is scrambled
        - data remains confidential
            - can only be read by person with decryption key
            - eg: not by system admins
        - independent data security (from device) 
    - disadvantages
        - hard to administer encryption keys
        - if key is lost, data is lost
        - need more processing power
            - expensive
        - cross application incompatibility
        - it staff needs specialized training
        - symmetric keys have to be distributed everytime data is sent
            - increases preparation time


### Asymmetric

- advantages
    - public keys can be accessed by anyone
        - so, no need to send key to specific user
    - uses private key (know only to user)
    - very secure
    - data encrypted from one key can be decrypyted with the other
    - so, can transmit data securely
    - its possible beause keys are mathetically linked using the RSA algorithm
    - key is large
        - eg: 1024 bits, 2048 bits
    - keys are re-usable 


### Quantam Cryptography

- use in internet
    - for cryptographic tasks
    - detects interception of data 
    - extreme fast calculations
    - can use higher bi-length for keys
        - increasing security (after encrypted)
    - ?? mathematic algorithms are still needed ??
    - use photons to carry data
        - difficult to control
        - more consistent
    - requires pure fibres to transmit photons
        - undisturbed over anything but short distances
        - max: 60KM
    - need new generation of computers
    - in theory, can break any (pre-quantam cryptographic) encryption very quickly


## AAA

### Authentication

- ensure authentication
    - user id with passowrd / pin
    - request random selection of PIN
    - send OTP to user
        - enter OTP after password
        - OTP is checked
        - (its a one time password, generated by a security token)

        - is biometric data is stored in centralized database
        - at the event
        - scans biometric parameter
        - compares data from new scan to encrypted data
        - system finds match in database
        - check if have access / authorization
            - check if have balance / money
            - if yes, pay and issue reciept
    - advantages

    - Databases are easily accessed
        - and edited
    - systems can be networked 
        - (for easy data sharing)
    - hard to maintain control over data
    - data can be stolen (without a trace)
    - protect user privacy
        - Data about individuals can be stored without their knowledge so infringing their privacy
    - ?? Keeping records of who/what/when data is accessed are difficult to maintain unless enforced by law ??

        2. Personal data can be held only for specified and lawful purposes.
            - Data subject should know why data is collected/stored.
            - Law is broken if data is used for other purposes.
        3. Personal data should be adequate, relevant and not excessive for the required purpose.
            - Only data that is needed can be stored.
        4. Personal data should be accurate and kept up-to-date.
            - Wrongnnaccurate data must not be stored.
            - Wrong/inaccurate data should be corrected.
        5. Personal data should not be kept for longer than is necessary.
            - Data must not be kept forever/unreasonable lengths of time/must be destroyed when no longer needed.
        6. Data should be processed in accordance with the rights of the data subject.
            - Data subjects can inspect the data held about them.
            - Data subjects can insist that incorrect data is amended.
