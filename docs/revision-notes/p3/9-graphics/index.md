## Bitmap Images

- compression
    - why
        - reduce file size
            - use less storage
            - faster file transmission
                - emails
                - loading web pages
            - low image resolution for small screens
            - glitch art can make use lossy compression artefacts to alter images
                - JPEG (lossy) might have artefacts 
    - methods
        - lossy
            - how (1)
                - Images are reduced in quality
                - Information is lost forever
                    - cannot be restored
                - algorithm removes areas with low detail more than areas of high detail
                - so image is changed from original
                - compression artefacts may appear
                - Image quality reduced with repeated compression
                - because at each compression, more image information is lost
            - analysis / how (2)
                - Loss of image data
                    - has visible effect
                    - image quality is reduced
                - Compression artefacts 
                    - produced during compression
                    - can be visible
                        - so, reduce image quality
                - Sudden changes in colour in an image can cause rings near the edges
                - Conversion of a gradation in tone by loss of data into fewer tones causes posterisation
                - False edges created
                    - contouring 
                    - because reduction of grey levels
                - Loss of data in curves
                - low quality due to 
                    - low colour depth
                    - Reduction in resolution
                - might can mistake text in images and change the meaning 
                    - e.g. 6 mistaken for 8.

        - lossless
            - no information is lost
            - Image is recreated with no difference from the original
            - Works well with images with blocks of similar pixels
            - because only need to store data for one pixel and number of pixels
            - No loss of quality
            - algorithms can reconstuct original pixels lost by compression

- edtiting tools
    - morphing (sad face -> happy face)
        - Uses forward mapping of pixels from one image into next
        - sad face mapped to new position in smiling face
        - Setting of control points in start image to map exactly to points in final image
        - Pixels in start image mapped to points in final image that are determined by 'weighting'
            - Gaussian function in software
        - Pixels next to control point move more than those further away/
            - less than control points
        - Pixels further away from control point are less affected by software algorithm so move less.

            - use compression to reduce file size
            - Bitmap files translate well (eg: when printing)
            - large file size, when large no. of colors
            - techniques to view image quickly
            - Data compression

                    - (decompression should happen)
            - enlarging causes pixellation
            - support transparency so can be used on any background.

- file formats
    - files
        - contains pixels and metadata
        - pixel has color depth (number of colors)
        - metadata is data about the file
            - image source
            - copyright information
            - device information (which phot was taken from)
        - file format may allow compression
        - compression maybe lossless
            - or lossy
    - why?
        - pg36
    - types
        - jpeg
            - both lossy and lossless
            - used for web
                - supported by web browsers
            - suffers image degradation
                - (when repeatedly edited and saved)
            - need more processing power (to compress)
            - no transparency support (easily)

            - doesnt support animations

## Vector Images

- advantages
    - easier to edit
    - Editing does not affect the quality
        - does not pixelate on enlarging
    - have smaller file size
        - saves storage
    - download faster than bitmap image
    - so can be displayed on low-power devices
    - Edges are smoother
        - well defined (in SVG)
    - producing a higher quality image
    - supports transparency
- disadvantages
    - Photographs are not realistic
    - surfaces are unrealistic
    - Small editing errors are more visible
    - reduces the image quality
    - hard to add special effects is more difficult
    - hard to add color graients
    - need powerful devices
        - to carry out calculations
        - when editing
    - may vary on software being used to view
    - converted to raster/bitmap images before displayed on screen/monitor

- structure
    - node
        - what
            - Control point for paths in image
            - Has defined positions on the x- and y- axes
            - Determines direction/vector of path
            - Defines/shows the start and end points of paths.
        - node editing
            - (related to ['Vectors Images - Editing'](#) section)
            - nodes can be joined together
            - moved to change the path direction
            - Add a new nodes (to change shape)
            - Delete a node
            - symmetrical nodes 
                - to create smooth flowing curves
            - asymmetrical nodes 
                - to obtain a different amount of curve on each side
                - of the node (keeping a smooth flow through the node)
            - cusp nodes to create extreme changes in direction
                - change the length and direction 
                - of each control arm independently
            - smooth nodes 
                - for smooth transitions between straight line segments

- tools (/ techniques)
    - to change appearance of objects
        - Use of Bezier handles to change angle of line / control-point
        - Moving node to change the start/end points of
            - Bezier curves (that make up rounded shape)
        - Moving node from one position to another
        - Adding node to line to divide line into two and moving new node
        - Deleting nodes to join lines and remove curves
        - Group shapes to allow for movement of parts of images
        - Changing the colour/transparency/size/rotation of shape
        - Manually editing the code in the SVG XML file.

- files
    - svg (scalable vector graphics)
        - why
            - open-source
            - a W3C standard (World Wide Web Consortium)
            - based on XML which is standardized
            - can be imported into many graphics software
            - Format is scripting, so can be used with CCS
            - supported by web & print systems
            - No compression applied
            - Use of XML + mathematical calculations 
                - image can be scaled without quality loss
        - information stored
            - The font to be used.
            - shapes
                - dimensions
                - position on screen
                - style
                - colors to fill shape
            - lines
                - dimensions
                - position on screen
                - colors to draw line

- how it resizes without quality loss?
    - vector images are mathematical expressions of shapes/paths (to create images)    
    - Shapes include lines/polygons
    - Points defined with x-y axes and direction of path
    - Shapes and positions are recalculated every time the image is resized 
    - so quality is retained
    - Lines in vector images do NOT change proportionately when resized
    - bitmaps
        - consist of a set number of pixels
        - when resized
            - number of pixels change
            - lines change proportionately
            - so, quality is altered 

- uses
    - outline fonts to describe printable characters
    - as svg on web pages (HTML5)
    - used by pen plotters to draw shapes on paper

## Common

### Stuff

- resolutions
    - basics
        - Resolution is measured in PPI (pixels per inch)
        - Low resolution images 
            - few pixels
        - High resolution mages 
            - many pixels
            - have higher quality
            - looks crisper
    - why different resoltions needed
        - for (professional) printing
            - need high resolution
            - 600ppi or more
        - images for magazines
            - 300ppi
        - Poster images on bill boards 
            - 150ppi
            - low, cuz viewed from far distance
        - viewing on screen
            - matches PPI of screen/monitor
        - for web
            - mid: 72ppi or 100ppi (modern retina screens)
            - for fast loading
            - but enough quality to view
            - use pixel dimensions
                - (not resolution)
                - can have differing resolutions
                - but display at same size
                - (and looks the same)
        - for presentations 
            - standard: 1024x768 + 72ppi
            - (projectors, large TVs)

### Colors

- color systems
    - RGB
        - stuff
            - use additive colors (to create color ranges)
            - adding all colors together -> white
            - used in computer screens
    - CMYK
        - stuff
            - use subtractive colors (to create color ranges)
            - adding all colors together -> black
            - used for printing
                - black has to be added
                    - CMY is muddy brown color
                    - so, most printers use black catridge when printing CMYK
                    - (inkjet printers, both catridges being used)
    - comparisons
        - RGB vs CMYK
            - similarities
                - color codes for defining colors
                - can produce many colors
                    - from white -> black
                - highly supported by many apps
                - affected by differences in display media 

### Editing

- tools
    - layer tool
        - To separate elements of image
            - to worked on independently
        - To overlay elements onto others 
            - each element can be moved independently of the others
        - allows editing of elements while leaving other elements untouched
        - do stuff to one element/layer (without affecting others)
        - allows transparency effects (of objects)
        - To insert text 
            - writing can be placed anywhere on the image
    - flatten tool
        - To merge all layers into one layer
        - To discard hidden layers 
            - make all layers are visible
        - To fill any transparent areas with white 'background colour'
        - to create pdf to print easily
        - To reduce the file size

### Conversions

- bitmap to vector
    - how
        - (Clearly defined) areas in the bitmap are automatically traced to create objects in the vector image
        - Nodes are added to the objects
        - Object manually corrected by user to merge shapes
        - Colour resolution (number of bits) reduced by user

### Comparisons

- bitmap vs vector
