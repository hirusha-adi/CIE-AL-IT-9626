## Computer Animations

- key frames
    - why
        - to define start and end of movement of an object
        - to specify movement of objects
            - that the viewer will see
        - to define timing of movement
            - by position of key frame in sequence of frame
    - property key frames
        - defines (one or more) properties of an object in a frame
            - (Objects properties) 
            - can be edited (within a property key frame)
        - to create in-between (tween) frames without the need to draw each frame individually
        - used as 'roving' (property key frames)
        - ensures speed of motion is consistent between frames
            - (throughout a tween)
        - to adjust the speed of motion 
            - at beginning and end of tween sequence so that it appears more realistic between frames/throughout a tween
        - to add properties of one object onto other
            - by copying property key frames in timelines

- video editing stuff
    - call animation
        - Background objects drawn on one cell and placed at bottom of stack of cells
        - Character to be moved drawn on transparent cell
            - placed on top of background and photographed
        - Character redrawn as moved (on transparent cell) and replaced
        - Re-photographed/digitised in next frame
        - Process repeated for subsequent frames.
    - stop motion
        - Scene arranged and lighted
        - Camera app setup
        - Frame recorded
        - Frame checked for corrections
        - Frame deleted if not required
        - objects moved slightly and re-photographed into new frame
        - Use of 'onion-skinning'
            - faint outline of previous frame in app 
            - to show placement of objects
        - Frames duplicated
        - to slow the motion down 
        - e.g. when character changes direction suddenly.

- animations
    - techniques
        - tweening
            - stuff
                - usues location points
                - changes motion by creating intermeddiate frame
                - requires establishment of keyframes
                - moves points of location of object to new points
                    - morphing doesn't do it
        - morphing
            - stuff
                - changes one object into different object
                - smooth
                - overlays grid on images & uses it to remap new image
        - tweening vs morphing
            - similarities
                - can change shape of an object
                - motion of object
                - can change size / color / location

- image editing, when making movies
    - Add visual special effects/CGI (computer-generated imagery) 
        - to video sequences 
        - show stuff that cannot exist in reality
    - Colourising monochrome film stock to increase acceptability
    - Images can be improved
        - eg: color grading
    Images can remove/include objects
    Images of impossible objects/situations can be created
    Altering photographic images to enhance 
        - sales of products (can mislead buyers)
        - appearance (can mislead fans)
