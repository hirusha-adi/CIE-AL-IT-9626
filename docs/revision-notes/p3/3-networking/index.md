## Network Classification

### LAN

### WAN

### Comparisons

- LAN vs WAN
    - LAN
        - small geographical area
        - high data transfer speeds
        - uses Ethernet / Token Ring technologies
        - connect together into bigger LANs using fiber optic cabling
        - owned by one organization (usually)
        - fewer errors raised (when transmitting data)
        - fewer congestion problems
        - use Layer 1 or Layer 2 devices
            - eg: switches, 
            - bridges,
            - hubs,
            - repeaters, etc...
    - WAN
        - uses ATM / Frame Relay
        - connect together using public telecommunication systems
        - has collective ownership
        - use Layer 3 devices
            - eg: routers
            - multi layer switches

## Network Models

### TCP/IP Model

### OSI Model

### Frame Relay

- why
    - supports high speed data transmission
    - connectionless service
        - each packet through network
        - contains address information
    - can use virtual circuits
        - they appear permanent to users
    - multiplexing of virtual circuits to share network bandwidth
    - can only detect errors at Data Link layer
        - so, no flow control
    - faulty frames dropped
        - no request for re-transmission
    - supports variable frame sizes
    - operated at Physical layer and Data Link Layer
        - so, can be used for internet
    - no error control
        - so it requires less reliable method 
        - for transmission    
- advantages
- disadvantages
    - frames delivered unreliably
        - have to be retransmitted if sender is aware (to resend)
        - frames may go missing
            - no acknowledgement from recieving packets
        - packets may not be delivered in same order as sent
        - no flow control
            - cannot stop data transmission 
            - if network is congested
            - so, data is lost
        - data is lost if frame doesnt get re-transmitted

### Comparisons

- TCP/IP vs OSI model
    - similarities
        - 
    - differences
        - 

## Data Transmission

### UDP

- packet header
    - four fields of 2 bytes
    - source port field used to reply if needed
    - dst port used to specify reciever port number
    - dst port is always required
    - header + data field 
        - (in bytes)
        - used for error checking
    - length of header (8 bytes minimum)
    - checksum field 
        - results of calculations
        - to be used to check errors
        - optional in IPv4
            - set to `0` if not calculated
        - required in IPv6  
- advantages
- disadvantages
    - no acknowledgement after recieving packet
    - not sure if packet lost or recieved
    - provides for ordering of packets so there is no tracking of messages
    - no congestion control 
        - so these have to be separately
        - carried at application level
    - Reciever must handle lack of handshake 
        - of data
        - increasing complexy/overheads.

        - appears stationary over target area
    - Multiple satellites 
        - can be arranged in constellation 
        - each covering of small area of surface
        - can cover areas farthest from equator
        - target specific areas of Earth
    - Satellite can use spot beams 
        - to target specific areas
        - provides high bandwidth 
    - Ground stations 
        - maintain permanent (microwave) links 
        - with satellites
        - Both uplink and downlink connections
        - via dish antenna
    - User 
        - has dish with transceiver 
        - via LNB pointed at satellite
        - dish needs to be line of sight
        - eg: dish in Southern hemisphere northerly direction.
    - MORE STUFF -> (for full marks)
    - Ground (gateway) stations 
        - have internet connection 
        - relay user internet data to from satellite
        - convert data carried by satellite signals to/from IP packets
    - Satellite 
        - serves to receive, amplify and re-transmit signal 
        - (without processing of data)
    - User 
        - has satellite modem 
        - to modulate/demodulate data 
        - between local IP packets 
            - and satellite link signals.

- advantages
    - Satellites are in geostationary orbit 
        - so ground stations for uplink 
        - can point directly at them 
        - so less power needed
    - Receiving dishes 
        - can point directly at satellite 
        - for less fluctuation (in signal)    
    - Low/medium orbit satellites
        - provide low latency connections 
        - with high speeds

    - Coverage can be optimised for high bandwidth
- disadvantages
    - Satellites in geostationary orbit are 
        - c. 18 000 km high 
        - so signal has to travel c. 36 000 km 
        - resulting in delay
            - high latency (worse than dial-up)
            - SSL may not succeed
            - TCP protocols may break
    - Interference by weather conditions 
        - can reduce signal quality
    - Must be line of sight to satellite
    - Reflections reduce signal quality 
        - by phase cancellation effects.

## Networking Models

### Client-Server

- explanation
    - all files in a centralized server
    - only one copy has to be maintained
    - files can be mirrored to other servers
        - for increased performance
        - without the need to copy to each device in use
    - disaster recovery is easy + quick
        - can quickly recovery backups
    - servers can be updated (easily scalable)
        - without upgrading user devices
    -  data shared across different devices
    - data can be accessed from different locations
        - (as long as the device is in the same network)
        - (or by using a VPN tunnel)
    - data can be queried from DBMS (SQL or No-SQL database)
        - regardless of interface
    - better data security
    - server can perform authentication before returning data  

### Peer to Peer

- advantages
    - No centralised system
    - so failure of one device does not affect others
    - Access to files is local/faster 
    - more productive to users
    - No need network operating systems
    - as its stores own files
    - Less knowledge to setup
    - less technicians needed
    - No central records of access are stored
    - so can be used for piracy
    - easy scaling
        - without performance impact
- disadvantages
    - Files not centrally organised
    - difficult to locate specific files
    - high Risk of malware
        - each peer/node is responsible for their own security 
    - Security is lower as not centrally deployed
    - no central Backup systems
        - user's responsibility to backup
    - document templates may exist in different versions
    - hard to be consistent
    - Files cannot be checked before download
    - security issued
        - no central control over access
        - Remote access can be insecure
    - one device down = affect others
        - that portion of files is lost

### BitTorrent

- how it works
    - Peers share processing power without a central server
    - Nodes work as both client and server for other nodes
    - Nodes can connect undstructured or in structured topology
    - Unstructured mode 
        - robust when nodes join/drop frequently 
        - but finding a file is more difficult
    - Structured mode is organised 
        - (using hash tables) 
        - and files can be found easily
    - Peer-to-peer software run on /node
        - Software queries other nodes to find file 
            - Search request 
                - has 'time to live' (TTL) 
                - after which it ceases to search
                - propagates from queried nodes to others
            - When found, 
                - software downloads from node to node
            - Other nodes can copy downloaded file from each node
    - fragments of file can be copied from different nodes at once,
        - increasing speed.

- why its insecure
    - Nodes more susceptible to remote attack
    - IP address is clearly visible to others so
        - (so, easy for hackers to target)
    - can use IP to steal user data
    - resulting in fraud / blackmail
    - Malicious code can edit routing tables of nodes
    - responses to requests can contain malicious code
    - so, we download malware instead of original resource 
    - Authors are unknown
        - so, may contain trojans/malware/stealers
    - Sections of files can be replaced with malware
    - Downloaded Bit Torrent files 
        - stored by default in folder along with other user data 
        - risking exposing the data to others
    - session can be left open unintentionally
    - Bit Torrent traffic is not encrypted by default
        - UDP and TCP ports used
            - might be subjected to monitoring by ISP
        - so, use VPN 
    - piracy (of copyrighted materials) give rise to legal issues

## Tunnelling

- why
    - set up VPN  
        - (allows data to be private)
    - data can be be kept secure when working remotely
        - (eg: working from home)
    - can circumvent firewall rules 
        - to allow access to internal network 
        - by data carried in packets
    - can use foreign' protocols on networks
        - (when its not supported)
        - e.g. use of IPv6 on IPv4 networks.
- how? (to tunnel over the internet)
    - data broken into small packets
        - (for transmission over IP network)
    - IP packets encapsulated by tunnelling protocol (L2TP)
    - IP packet sent over internet (public communication channels)
    - data is encrypted using SSH / IPSec
    - packets are decapsulated and unencrypted at destination 

### VPN

- evaluvate
    - Encrypts all data (secure)
        - protects privacy of user
    - changing the user IP address 
        - allows users to browse internet anonymously
        - prevents tracking of activity by ISP, trakcets, etc...
    - can configure to block advertisements
    - can bypass geo-restrictions
        -  access material from other countries
        - eg: journalists looking for news
        - movies, music, etc...
    - to bypass censorship (imposed by ISPs or countries)
    - can bypass ISP bandwidth
    - may be illegal in some countries (might lead to prosecution)
    - reduce performance and increase letency/ping
    - may collect data and sell to third party (data brokers)
    - can be difficult to set up
    - ?? need latest OS to use VPN ??
    - Some sites may block VPN
    - can be configured to allow an extranet to be set allowing remote access to a private network


## Cloud Computing

- storing data in cloud
    - meaning
        - store in network of servers
        - accessed over internet
        - Access available from any (remote) device
        - data may be managed by third parties
        - managed by a cloud storage provider.
    - security issues
        - Data not under our direct control
        - depends on third party for security
            - cannot trust third party companies with our data
        - Data is susceptible to cyber-attack 
            - as only accessible over intemet
            - as multiple copies of data (buckups)
            - attack to servers 
                - e.g. DOS attacks
                - uses all server resources
        - Data accessible to government check / subpoenas
        - data loss, may result in legal issues
            - could storage provider is responsible
        - Data is difficult permanently
            - already in cloud
            - already had multiple copies (backup)
        - not standardised across all companies
            - if a company using cloud storage
            - they might not be able to change supplier 
        - cannot access data without internet (while offline)

        - information unfolds quickly
    - leads to crucial information being overlooked
    - difficult to customised pages.


### Proxy Server

- evaluvate
    - intermediate gateway between client and websites
        - so, websies cannot log activity of user
        - cannot log IP
            - so, cannot determine geolocation
            - keeps clients identity secure + private
        - can do access control
        - can filter out unwanted stuff
        - can cache frequenly used websites
            - reduced internet usage
            - but user may recieve outdated info
            - user will not know and will use old data
        - can encrypt web requests from client (enforce HTTPS)
        - can provide VPN services (for remote access)
            - eg: students remotely accessing school network
        - high latency (as all traffic goes through the body)

### Printer Server

- explanation
    - Accept print jobs from client devices
    - Manage print job to printer
    - Queue print jobs (if printer is busy)
    - management of print queues
    - quota of print jobs
    - can enforce admin policies
    - Allow authentication
        - water-marking of print jobs.

### Web Server

- explanation
    - store html documents (on secondary storage devices)
    - store media/scripts/stylesheets associated with HTML documents
    - process incoming network requests
    - use HTTP(S) to receive/deliver communications
    - provides server-side script services (for dynamic web pages)

### FTP Server

- how it works
    - uses file transfer protocol
    - between server and client
    - FTP addresses being with `ftp://`
        - (to indicate the protocol required to transfer)
    - server listens for USER and PASS commands
        - (username and password)
    - FTP uses port 21 (by default)
    - active mode 
        - uses port 21 
        - for connection with client
    - passive mode is used 
        - if client is behind a firewall
        - (if unable to recieve incoming TCP connections)
        - sets up different port (for c-s data connections) 
    - USER and PASS are not encrypted (by default)
        - encrypted in 
            - SFTP (Secure FTP - over SSH)
            - uses port 22 (ssh)
    - server sends acknowledgement 
        - to client 
        - if valid credentials
        - and session is opened
    - anonymous access can download, but not upload
    - server allows checkpoints
        - so, downloads can be resumed (if interrupted) 
            
### E-Mail

- explanation
    - Manage email accounts
    - Host domains for provision of email accounts
    - Send email using Simple Mail Transfer Protocol/SMTP

        - only to be used for bussiness
        - can have more emails at no extra cost
        - company can control email policy
            - authorization
        - company has more control over email
        - more secure, as we own the data
        - can archive emails
            - eg: for later reference, for legal requirements
        - can be filtered/scanned for malware
            - before delivered to employee
        - can set a max size for sender
    - disadvantages
        - complex to configure
        - need experts to setup
            - expensive
        - hard to maintain
        - SMTP services of email from own server are prihibited on ISP accounts
            - extra costs
        - hard to avoid blacklists
            - eg: for bad DNS listing

- how emails are sent and recieved (basic)
    - Mail server provides email services to email client
    - Email client sends request to server
    - Server sends a response to email client
    - Email client logs-in to mail server
    - Rules for requests are determined by protocols
        - eg: SMTP, IMAP, POP3
    - Messages are transferred between client and server
        - (from emails stored on server).

### Instant Messaging

- advantages
    - simple to setup
    - accessible any time
    - accessible with any device
        - no need specific hardware
    - gives real-time communication

    - group chats
    - custom-written apps more secure than emails
        - specially using: end-to-end encryption
- disadvantages

## Other

- video streaming, viewing resolution affected, p3-ch2-pg71
    - The more available bandwidth on the connection the higher quality of video that can be streamed
    - Use of a 3G connection to the intemet limits video/streaming to low bit rate of 400 Kb/s
    - Buffers not filled completely so video pauses/stops/jerky if frames not received fast enough
    - Provides video of 320 x 240 pixels without apparent stuttering/buffering/stop-start issues
    - This will be a poor video/low definition video as seen on the 1024 x 576 screen
    - Use of a 4G connection with higher bandwidth of c. 15Mbit/s allows video with higher bitrates to be viewed properly
    - This is 1024 x 576 is possible and this is HD quality
    - Highest bit rates of 19/ 30 Mbit/s allowing resolutions of up to 1920 x 1080 pixels
    - Available/can be streamed over Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.1 g) wireless connections....
    - Which have a maximum of 54 Mbit/s
    - 1920 x 1080 pixels will have to be downscaled for viewing on the smartphone screen
    - Which may lead to artefacts and loss of quality.
