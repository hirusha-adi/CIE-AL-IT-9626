- video streaming, viewing resolution affected, p3-ch2-pg71
    - The more available bandwidth on the connection the higher quality of video that can be streamed
    - Use of a 3G connection to the intemet limits video/streaming to low bit rate of 400 Kb/s
    - Buffers not filled completely so video pauses/stops/jerky if frames not received fast enough
    - Provides video of 320 x 240 pixels without apparent stuttering/buffering/stop-start issues
    - This will be a poor video/low definition video as seen on the 1024 x 576 screen
    - Use of a 4G connection with higher bandwidth of c. 15Mbit/s allows video with higher bitrates to be viewed properly
    - This is 1024 x 576 is possible and this is HD quality
    - Highest bit rates of 19/ 30 Mbit/s allowing resolutions of up to 1920 x 1080 pixels
    - Available/can be streamed over Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.1 g) wireless connections....
    - Which have a maximum of 54 Mbit/s
    - 1920 x 1080 pixels will have to be downscaled for viewing on the smartphone screen
    - Which may lead to artefacts and loss of quality.
