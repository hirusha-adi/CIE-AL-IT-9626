## Data Transmission

### UDP

- packet header
    - four fields of 2 bytes
    - source port field used to reply if needed
    - dst port used to specify reciever port number
    - dst port is always required
    - header + data field 
        - (in bytes)
        - used for error checking
    - length of header (8 bytes minimum)
    - checksum field 
        - results of calculations
        - to be used to check errors
        - optional in IPv4
            - set to `0` if not calculated
        - required in IPv6  
- advantages
- disadvantages
    - no acknowledgement after recieving packet
    - not sure if packet lost or recieved
    - provides for ordering of packets so there is no tracking of messages
    - no congestion control 
        - so these have to be separately
        - carried at application level
    - Reciever must handle lack of handshake 
        - of data
        - increasing complexy/overheads.

    - does routing decisions between networks
    - have own broadcast domain
    - store routing data in 'routing tables'
    - contains WAP in same physical unit (AIO)
    - mostly does packet switching only
- routing
    - static
        - created by network admins
        - does not (automatically) consider network conditions
        - routes are fixed
        - routing tables are not updated
        - routing table does not time out
    - dynamic
        - generated by algorithms
        - creates routing table
            - by considering real-time logical network layouts
        - can adjust to changing network conditions
        - routing changes shared between routers
        - can  limit number of hops
        - have limited time-to-live data
            - cuz table will be updated

        - similarities
            - used in routers
            - to determine next hop to send packet
            - algorithms create a 'forwarding table' 
                - (routing table)
                - when choosing the next route
                - its stored in non-volatile memmory 
                    - (of router hardware)
            - provides default route for packet
                - if no route can be determined


### Hubs


### Switches

- stuff
    - used in LANs
    - all ports in switch has same broadcast domain
    - store data in a CAM (content addressable memmory) table with MAC addresses
    - usually wired only
    - can configure to do
        - circuit switching
        - message switching
        - packet switching
- types
    - L2 switch
        - in L3 (data link layer) of OSI model
        - connects nodes in same network
    - L3 switch
        - in L3 (network layer) of OSI model
        - can connect two networks
        - deals with frames & also packets
        - work with MAC addresses (frames)

        - provide high transmission rates
        - can work in full duplex mode
        - can work in  broadcat, multicast and unicast 


## Wired

- data transferring
    - unencrypted
    - less subjected to interference
    - cannot easily intercept
    - no need credentials to connect
    - requires device to be physically connected
        - so, less portable

## Wireless

- why less secure (in LAN)
    - might be unencrypted
    - easier to intercept (than wired connections)
    - Access points can be 'spoofed'
    - access points broadcast SSID (network ID) to public.
- data transferring
    - slow speeds
    - high latency
    - need recognition of connection between devices
    - requires connection to be encrypted
    - requires user to input credentials
    - encrypted data is easier to intercept (even if no meaning)
    - easier & cheaper to install
    - signal interference from other devices
    - more portability to client devices 

### Microwave Transmissions

- advantages
    - directional antennae
        - increased performance
        - low power usage
        - point directly at each other
            - can use same frequencies 
            - (as neighbouring transmissions) 
            - without interference
    - Narrow microwave beams do not interfere (with other equipment)
    - Small antennae means more portable 
        - e.g. portable radio systems
    - large bandwidth
        - carry more data

- disadvantages
    - tall antennae 
        - difficult to install
    - Line of sight required
        - antenna cannot be 'over horizon' (earth curvature)
        - (limited to 50-80 km)
        - else,
            - obstacles will interfere
            - Unable to penetrate obstacles
            - causes interference
        - so position antennas intrusively
    - atmospheric conditions can degrade signal
        - (weather)
        - 'Rain fade' absorbs microwaves by weather
        - dust / smoke / high-pollen-counts because signal scatters (by particles)
        - Solar events
    - ?? can be intercepted behind official antenna (eg: by space satellite) ??

### WiFi

- stuff
    - asymmetrical
        - one central point to many remote devices
    - uses a central access point (usually)
    - covers wider area
    - complex to establish a connection
        - requires a lot of authentication and encryption stuff
- how WiFi connection is established
    - User selects Wi-Fi connection (SSID) 
        - (from list of available connections)
    - Connection to a WAP (in a router) (1st)
        - which is wired into the LAN
    - Uses radio waves
        - frequencies in the 2.4/5 GHz range
        - to carry data packets
    - Wi-Fi uses frames 
        - uses Wi-Fi protocols
        - working at data link layer of TCP/IP stacks 
        - (to carry data over radio waves)
    - WAP sends beacon frames at intervals to announce its SSID
    - Smartphone sends authentication frames (probe frames) 
        - to WAP 
        - requesting connection.
    - WAP responds with authentication credentials
    - User input of authentication credentials to establish security
        - encryption for data exchange, eg:
            - WPA2 (and variants)/
            - TKIP protocols/
        - using 128/256 bit keys for encryption
    - error control used between smartphone and WAP when maintain connection

    - Spread spectrum technology allows multiple connections on same frequencies
    - Multiple input and multiple output (MIMO) 
        - using multiple transmit/receive antenna 
        - to increase data flow
    - Antennae from base stations directional to avoid
        - so, no interference to other towers
    - Adjacent cells use different frequencies from neighbouring cells
    - wireless frequencies 
        - are re-used by cells 
        - distant from each other 
        - to increase capacity 
        - (where ranges of frequencies are limited)

### 5G, 4G, 3G

- 5G
    - feaures (suitable for large networks)
        - large connection capacity
            - upto a million devices per km<sup>2</sup>
        - very high bandwidth (data transfer)
        - very low latencies (fast responses)
        - seamless handover between base stations
        - use 'beam-forming' techniques
            - by base stations
            - to improve connections to specific devices
- 4G
    - stuff
        - use only packet switching

- 3G

- 4G vs 3G
    - higher bandwidth
        - due to higher range of frequencies
        - due to use of MIMO 
            - (multiple input and multiple output)
            - using multiple transmit/recieve antenna 
            - to increase use of transmission channels
        - connections use frequency multiplex division to share
        - due to use of spread spectrum technology
            - to allow multiple connections
            - on same set of frequencies
        - gives
            - faster download speeds
            - more buffering capacity
            - content loads faster
    - handovers between base stations are smoother

    - security issued
        - no central control over access
        - Remote access can be insecure
    - one device down = affect others
        - that portion of files is lost


- video streaming, viewing resolution affected, p3-ch2-pg71
    - The more available bandwidth on the connection the higher quality of video that can be streamed
    - Use of a 3G connection to the intemet limits video/streaming to low bit rate of 400 Kb/s
    - Buffers not filled completely so video pauses/stops/jerky if frames not received fast enough
    - Provides video of 320 x 240 pixels without apparent stuttering/buffering/stop-start issues
    - This will be a poor video/low definition video as seen on the 1024 x 576 screen
    - Use of a 4G connection with higher bandwidth of c. 15Mbit/s allows video with higher bitrates to be viewed properly
    - This is 1024 x 576 is possible and this is HD quality
    - Highest bit rates of 19/ 30 Mbit/s allowing resolutions of up to 1920 x 1080 pixels
    - Available/can be streamed over Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.1 g) wireless connections....
    - Which have a maximum of 54 Mbit/s
    - 1920 x 1080 pixels will have to be downscaled for viewing on the smartphone screen
    - Which may lead to artefacts and loss of quality.

## Tunnelling

- why
    - set up VPN  
        - (allows data to be private)

        - to allow access to internal network 
        - by data carried in packets
    - can use foreign' protocols on networks
        - (when its not supported)
        - e.g. use of IPv6 on IPv4 networks.
- how? (to tunnel over the internet)
    - data broken into small packets
        - (for transmission over IP network)
    - IP packets encapsulated by tunnelling protocol (L2TP)
    - IP packet sent over internet (public communication channels)
