- conditionals
    - types
        - `if...else`
            - explain
                - If ... else allows different actions to occur as a condition
                - condition produces a Boolean result
                - If TRUE an action is taken
                - If FALSE another (different) action is taken
                - Number is stored in variable

        - ternary operator
            - Reduces code to a single statement to make code small
            - take up less storage space
            - Code is less complex to understand
            - easier to wite
            - less repetitive coding
            - Code is easier to debug
            - Can run multiple operations with code that is easier to follow
        - `switch...case`
            - Variable declared to store a specified condition
            - `switch(...)` used to gather data to be tested against the variable
            - Use of case to create blocks of code that may be executed
            - Variable with the condition listed for testing (against case)
            - Use of break to end out of `switch(...)` when variable matches case
            - Use of default at end of code block to specify code to be executed if no match found


- inbuilt functions
    - `setTimeout()`
        - stuff
            - delays execution of code
                - which runs only once
            - minimum time is 0 miliseconds
    - `setInterval()`
        - stuff
            - allows repeated code execution
            - at pre-set intervals
            - minimum time is 10 miliseconds
            - can stop the timeout timer
                - so, `setTimeout()` won't be executed
    - `confirm()`
        - a dialog box with two elements appear
            - OK button
                - indicates acceptance

                - or explains the choices available 
            - a Close button (in some browsers)
                - to give no answer and close the question
        - why it may cause problems
            - User's attention drawn away from main web page 
                - lose concentration (on page content)
            - Input focus is taken away from the web site/pages until box is closed 
                - no other interaction is possible
            - Other codes may stop functioning until the dialogue box is closed
            - Position of dialog box cannot be controlled 
                - (may block information on page)
            - some browsers may badly support it
        - result returned back
            - Return value 
                - is Boolean
                - stored in a declared variable
            - If user clicks OK then `true` is returned to variable
            - if cancel, `false` is returned

            - user presses OK
            - if no value is entered, `NULL` is returned
            - if cancel is pressed, `NULL` is returned
        - limitations
            - position cannot be specified
                - determines by browser
                - may not be ideal for user
            - appearance chosen by browser
            - script is paused until box is closed
            - additional code required to validate data
            - some browsers support a default value feature
    - `eval()`
        - why not run string as code
            - allows inserted code to run
            - security issues
    - `console.log()`
        - writes message to browser console
        - need supporting browsers (new versions)
        - need to open console to see them
        - used for testing purposes
        - message within brackets will appear in console
            - is a string / object
            - is required
            - can have more than one object
                - objects can be variables
    - `sort()`
        - questions
            - question 1
                - ![alt text](image-14.png) 
                - answer
                    - treats values as strings not numbers
                    - Strings are sorted alphabetically
                    - Strings are not sorted numerically
                    - a is before  than b so list 1 is sorted alphabetically by the first letter
                    - and then by the second etc.
                    - because 2 is 'bigger' than 1
    - `reverse()`
        - reverses a string, a list, etc...
    
    - comparisons
        - `setTimeout()` vs `setInterval()`
            - similarities
                - both are part of DOM (Document Object Model)
                    - (HTML Window Object)
                - both takes two parameters
                    - first parameter: function to be executed
                    - second parameter: a time in miliseconds
                - both can be interrupted using `clearInterval()` function

- event handlers
    - `onerror()`
        - eg: `window.onerror = function_name(msg, url, line);`
        - triggered when an exception occurs
        - `onerror()`
            - only captures error
            - stores details for later
        - function passes event details to alter box
        - variables to pass paramaters of errors
        - parameters
            - `msg`
                - message that browser displays
            - `url`
                - file name of code in which error occured
            - `line`
                - line which contains the error


- debugging / finding errors
    - questions
        - question 1
            - ![alt text](image-1.png)
            - answer
                - it does not work
                - syntax error
                    - how the string `x` is designed
                - strings must be enclosed in matching quotes
                - quotes inside cannot be same as quotes outside
                    - either `'` or `"`
                - or use a backslash `\` to escape it

- exception handling
    - use '`throw`' to trap error
    - Use '`try`' to handle the error
    - Use '`catch`' to run code after if error
        - to show custom error message
        - eg: `message.innerHTML = "Error"`
    - Use '`finally`' to execute code regardless of error or not
    - Use '`error`' to provide information about the error, eg:
        - EvalError
        - RangeError
        - ReferenceError
        - SyntaxError
        - TypeError
        - URlError

- conventions
    - declarations at start
        - creates cleaner code
        - single place to look for all local variables
        - easier to avoid unwanted local variables
        - reduce unwanted re-declarations
    - initialize variables when first declared
        - avoids undefined values
        - create conside code, easier to follow
        - single place to initialize variables
    - always declare local variables
        - local variables declared with `var` keyword
        - otherwise, they become global variables

- program execution flow
    - questions
        - question 1
            - ![alt text](image-2.png)
            - answer
                - Script embedded in HTML code
                - between` <script> </script>` tags
                - Variables `x` and `y` declared
                - vairables initialized with values
                    - x stores 12 and y stores 6
                - `window.alert(x + y);` 
                    - sums x and y to produce 18
                    - displays an alert box
                - Appears as popup
                - User must press OK to clear
        - question 2
            - ![alt text](image-3.png)
            - ![alt text](image-4.png)
            - ![alt text](image-5.png)
            - answer
                - Line 9 `<script>` declares the code to be JavaScript.
                - Line 10 declares a function called
                - Line 11 declares variable report.
                - Line 12 declares variable result.
                - Line 12 collects value/18 of 'myTScore' from user input into HTML code at line 5 and stores it in variable 'result
                - Line 14 'switch' function is used to compare the value in 'result' against pre- set 'case' values.
                - Line 15 checks value of 'result' to see if condition is TRUE.
                - Line 18 checks value of 'result' to see if condition is TRUE.
                - Line 21 checks value of 'result' to see if condition is TRUE.
                - Line 24 checks value of 'result' to see if condition is TRUE
                    - all of these are FALSE
                    - control moves to next case
                - Line 27 checks value of 'result to see if condition <20 is TRUE
                    - this is TRUE so control passes to Line 28 and FAIL comment is stored in variable `report`
                - Line 33 function displays contents of variable '`report`' on webpage/displays "Your result is a Fail";
                - '`break`' is included to exit/jump out of any case
                - '`default`' is included in case no preceding is TRUE
                - Including '`default`' is good coding practice even if not required.
        - question 3
            - ![alt text](image-6.png)
            - answer
                - If statement specifies block of code that is executed if a condition is TRUE
                - Line 4 if statement compares 'age' with condition <10
                - if TRUE 'You are not old enough...'is stored in variable 'statement'
                - if FALSE execution is passed to line 6
                - Else-if statement specifies a new condition to be checked if the first condition is FALSE
                - Line 6 else if statement compares 'age' with condition <18
                - if TRUE 'You can go to this is stored in variable 'statement'
                - if FALSE execution is passed to line 8 and "You are too old to go to this school" is stored in variable 'statement'
                - Else statement specifies the code to be executed if condition is FALSE.
        - question 4
            - ![alt text](image-7.png)
            - answer
                - The order of Case/conditions checks in code must be logically correct/perfect
                    - for correct lexpected comparisons to be made
                    - (Switch) syntax does not follow the usual rules/colons not semi-colons so
                    - code is difficult/confusing to write/read
                    - Code can be lengthy as each condition has to be individually stated
                        - this is repetitive and prone to error
                    - 'break' has to be manually inserted after every 'case'
                    - debugging problems/difficulties with 'nested' conditions
                    - 'default' condition should be included to catch/trap unexpected conditions.
        - question 5
            - ![alt text](image-8.png)
            - ![alt text](image-9.png)
            - answer
                - Line 4 declares the variable/var length to hold one side of rectangle
                - Line 5 declares the variable/var width to hold other side of rectangle
                - parseFloat (prompt("")); used to display message
                - parseFloat (prompt("")); used to collect values for both sides of rectangle
                - parseFloat (prompt("")); used to create a (text) box for the user to enter the values
                - Variable/var calc area is declared to calculate the area
                - Holds result of calculation
                - document.write() is used to display the messages on screen about the
                - values/area of the rectangle
                - Displays the results of the calculation/contents of var calc_area.
        - question 6
            - ![alt text](image-10.png)
            - answer
                - Line 7 contains a syntax error
                - "Peter" is enclosed in quotes that are the same as the quotes for the string
                - (Strings in JavaScript can contain quotes but) the quotes in a string must not be the same as the enclosing quotes
                - Any syntax error causes the script to fail/not run
                - No error message is produced.
        - question 7
            - ![alt text](image-11.png)
            - answer
                - Code is embedded in HTML code of the website by `<script>` and `</script>` delimiters/markers
                - The browser executes the JavaScript code within the delimiters
                - Variable crops is set to contain the list of crops
                - Variables i and show are initialised
                - While loop will continue looping as long as crops contains data/string
                - (var) i is incremented by 1 each time loop is executed
                - (var) show is set to the current value of show concatenated with next crop value
                - Loop terminates when array has no more items/final value in array is reached
                - Final values of (var) show are displayed on screen/web page
                - Values shown in vertical list as <br> code forces carriage return/line feed.
