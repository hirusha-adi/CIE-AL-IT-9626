    - link between tasks
    - can be 
        - resource based
            - where eg: not enough space to carry both tasks
        - logic based
            - where eg: one task has to be carried before another
    - due to preferences of project manager
        - for one task to be done before another
        - eg: create logo before slogan

        - average costs of several estimates
            - 'three-point' estimating 
        - calculate cost of every activity in detail and calculate total
            - bottom up estimation
        - using PERT estimates by calculation (learn more [here](#stuff-1))
            - most likely cost estimate
                - when project has no difficulties
            - worst possible cost estimate
                - all tasks succeeding better than expected
            - PERT 'three-point' estimating  to eliminate bias
                - provides estimate time taken for each task
                - allowing costs to be calculated

- resource allocation


## Stuff 1

- WBS (work breakdown structure)
    - purpose
        - hierarchial description 
            - of a project scope
            - to show to shareholders
        - describes 
            - all work required 
            - in all stages of development
            - so everyone know what has to be done
        - each layer
            - describes what has to be done
            - to reach the end stage 
    - characteristics (of well designed WBS)
        - descriptions easily understandable
        - work can be dividable to managable units
            - to assign work to teams
            - to assign to individuals
        - can estimate duration of work
        - work is measurable
            - can calculate finishing time (estimate)
        - work units 
            - done by each one seperately
            - is put together
            - to create the whole project
        - adaptable to deal with changes to project scope

- PERT (performance evaluvation and review technique)

## Paths

- critical path
    - use
        - reduces risk of delays
        - as all are aware of project details
        - allows resources to be available when required
        - tasks can be scheduled in parallel
        - shows dependencies of tasks
            - so, can focus on critical ones
            - to improve chance of project success
        - use of 'floats'
            - in timings
            - can allow unexpected delays
        - complex acitivies difficult to represent on a diagram
            - \+ large diagrams are hard to understand  
        - external factors 
            - may change critical path analysis
            - will have to re-make / redo
        - pricing is estimates only, actual pricing may vary
        - resource details are limited 
            - so other methods need to be used
            - for charting
    - what to draw in diagram (to calculate critical path) ?
        - List of all the activities to finish
        - A breakdown of 
            - resource allocation
            - work schedules
        - Duration of each activity
        - Dependencies between activities
        - End points of each activity 
            - and what can be completed 
            - at that point
        - Measurable milestones
        - Duration of project including float variables.
    - outcomes that can be determined
        - A visual representation of the whole project
        - latest start dates for tasks
        - Longest time that taken
        - Expected end date
        - Shortest possible time to complete
        - ?? Any near/almost critical paths that may be possible altematives in project ??

## Charts

- gnatt chart
    - features
        - timeline to show progress of each tasks

        - current date (shows today's date)
        - milestones shown as check points
        - gnatt bar shows task duration (a graphical representation)
        - bars show planned start & end dates
        - labels showing contingency (eg: slack time)
        - colors representing eg: finished tasks
        - annotations/lines representing critical path
    - components
