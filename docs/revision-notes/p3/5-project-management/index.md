## Paths

- critical path
    - use
        - reduces risk of delays

        - allows resources to be available when required
        - tasks can be scheduled in parallel
        - shows dependencies of tasks
            - so, can focus on critical ones
            - to improve chance of project success

        - external factors 
            - may change critical path analysis
            - will have to re-make / redo
        - pricing is estimates only, actual pricing may vary
        - resource details are limited
