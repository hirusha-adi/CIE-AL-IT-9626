### Meaning

- process of analysing trends in larg quantity of data
- to show trends
- to show patterns

## Stages

They are:

- bussiness understanding
- data understanding
- data preparation
- data modelling
- evaluvating

###  Bussiness Understanding

- description
    - what is required?
    - is it worth the cost/risk?
    - success criteria
- tasks  (described)
    - identify bussiness goals and impact
    - assessing the situation
        - problem to be solved by data mining
    - producing a project plan


### Data Understanding

- description
    - identifies data sets to be used
    - ensure enough data is available
    - ensure we have enough time and resources
    - create a report about data sets to be used

### Data Preparation

- description
    - selects data to use
        - according to relevance (of requirements)
    - "cleaning"
        - remove redundant + irrelevant data
    - create combinations, by merging data with common characteristics

### Data Modelling

- description
    - out the mining to discover relationships
    - create new relationships to analyze patterns
    - document the mining
        - allows repetiton
        - and evaluvation of results

- tasks (described)
    - gather data required for the process
    - Documenting/describing the data, eg:
        - location of source
        - how it was acquired
    - Listing the source of data
    - Populate the analysis tool
    - Reviewing data to check 
        - completeness
        - anomalies
        - outliers
    - Visually checking the data for patterns
    - Verifying the quality gathered

### Evaluvating

- description
    - process against success criteria
    - if it is met
        - results shown to assess
    - else
        - model is amended, 
        - and re-run

### ?? Deployment ??


- tasks (described)
    - Plan how data mining results will be used
    - Creating a plan to maintain the model 
        - ensure it remains valid
    - process to new data to generate predictions/trends (required)
    - Reporting the final results of the data mining process
        - to check for errors
        - and how to correct them

## Uses        

### by a Bussinesses

- advantages
    - analyses large amounts of data from many sources
    - to discover trends
        - (that are not immediately obvious)
    - Retail businesses 
        - analyse historical data 
        - to predict who may respond to targeted advertising
        - to increase sales
        - who may respons to what advertising techniques 
            - using social media
            - emails
            - direct marketing
            - discounts
            - vouchers
        - who may buy related goods
    - Financial institutions 
        - analyses customer data 
        - to detect fraudulent credit card transactions
        - to protect user
        - determine who is interested in loans
    - Manufacturers 
        - analyse production data 
        - to detect faulty equipment
        - \+ determine optimal control parameters
        - to increase quality
        - \+ reduce errors

- disadvantages
    - privacy issues of extracting data from internet
    - so people reluctant to allow their data to be used
        - businesses cannot rely on the results of data mining 
        - to make informed decisions
    - may lose control of their customer data
    - will be responsible for data breaches
    - data might not be anonymised
    - data might be traced back
    - so dont like to provide personal info
    - legal liability if data leaked/lost
    - Data can be misused
    - to take advantage of vulnerable people

### by a Retail Bussinesses
- how
    - Divide customers into groups according to purchasing habits
        - e.g. recency/frequency/monetary (RFM) groups
        - different groups are targeted by different marketing campaigns
            - recent buyers sent money-off coupons with time limit
            - frequent customers sent coupons off regular purchases
            - big spenders dealt with differently from those who spend little at a time
    - help decide when to put items on sale
    - Can target customers
        - from purchasing habits
        - from loyalty card schemes
    - decide advertising campaigns worked
    - decide which items sold well (to different demographics)


### by a Health Care Organizations
- why
    - Identify patterns in large sets of data
    - Data patterns to predict trends in information
    - Compare symptoms to analyse disease causes
    - Determine the effectiveness of treatments
    - most effective course of treatment
    - Repeated analysis to standardise treatment of specific diseases
    - to speed up diagnosis
    - Determine patterns of medical claims by patients
    - Determine abnormal patient outcomes from treatments
    - Determine abnormal  patterns of medical claims by patients (to identify fraudulent claims)

### for Analyzing Social Trends

- advantages
    - Useful for 
        - predicting future trends
        - keeping track of customer habits
        - decision making
    - Speeds up the data analysis
    - people can collect information about marketed products
    - can find out fake products (with marketing analysis)
    - can create unexpected trends 
        - e.g. 'me-too' campaigns
    - can cause good influences
        - eg: anti-plastic movements
    - ?? Can influence the rebellion against plastic wrapped goods being identified by
    data mining of social trends ??

- disadvantages
    - Violates user privacy
    - collects irrelevant information
    - need skilled person analyze & understand 
    - security issues as data can be misused (to harm others)
    - Results can be sold to others 
        - without being anonymised
        - revealing personal details
    - Data patterns can be misused against
        - different social groups
    - Accuracy of data can be in doubt


### for Analyzing Economic Trends

- tasks
    - Identify anomalies in economic data
    - Searching for relationships between variables
    - Clustering 'similar' groups and structures
    - generalizing known structures (to apply to new data)
    - Finding functions that model the data with the least error
    - Summarising the data
    - Producing reports
    - charts/graphs to show trends in the data.


## Other / Unknown

- document analysis
    - use
        - advantages
            - a systematic process of reviewing printed and computer-based documents
                - provides a large amount of information
            - Data in documents is analysed to gain knowledge
                - requires the analyst to have knowledge (in that field)
            - Analyst should combine document research with other forms of analysis
                - Analysts should be highly skilled
            - uses data that has already been collected
                - only data selection is needed 
                - requires less time than other methods
                - costs only include the method of analysing
                - no costs for collecting data
                - cheap
                - Many documents are freely available
            - Document analysis uses non-invasive research methods
                - does not affect the subject being researched
            - Historical documents are not altered by being researched
                - so can be re-examined by analysts
            - Documents contain references that can be cross-refenced to other sources
                - making the research more reliable
        - disadvantages
            - documents are produced only as a record of an event
            - lacks insufficient detail to be useful in the research
            - Data may be inaccurately recorded
                - may not reflect actual events
            - physical documents, hard to search through
                - research can be prolonged
                - might miss important data
            - Researcher may be biased when selecting documents
                - data may be incomplete.
