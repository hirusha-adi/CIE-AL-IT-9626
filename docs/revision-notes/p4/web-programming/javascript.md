This note is mainly based on this video:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hdI2bqOjy3c?si=9EdJqrZ0bP_Nm4WW" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

For documentation about something, just google for: `<query> MDN` - MDN is Mozilla Developer Network, or, you can also search like: `<query> w3schools` - W3Schools is also another great site.
