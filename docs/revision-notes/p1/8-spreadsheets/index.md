## Spreadsheet Software

### Key Terms

- Cells
    - specific location within a spreadsheet
    - defined by intersection of row and column
    - referenced by a letter and a number combination
    - give an example
- Rows
    - runs horizonatally in a spreadsheet
    - each row is identified by a number in the row header
    - give an example
- Columns
    - runs vertically in a spreadsheet
    - each column is identified by a letter in the column field
    - give an example
- Worksheets
    - a single page in a spreadsheet
    - each worksheet has a name
    - default worksheets are named Sheet1, Sheet2, Sheet3, etc...
    - give an example

### for Modelling

- why use spreadsheet?
    - can use relative & absolute cell referencing
        - to only increment parts of formula
        - that we need
    - cell protection 
        - makes sure the cell's data doesnt change by accident
    - user interface forms
        - makes it easier to input values to the model
    - macros
        - makes it easier to perform complex functions
    - automatic-recalculation   
        - so, dont need to evaluvate formula everytime
        - will update automatically
    - conditional formatting
        - allows to highlight values that match specific criteria
    - graphs & charts to detect trends

- for financial models?
    - advantages
        - calculations performed more quickly
        - what-if statements can be asked/used
            - without re-building the model from scratch
        - provides quick answers to events
            - that may actually happen in a month, etc..
        - graphs produced to easily understand
            - are also updates automatically after re-calculation
        - they provide consisten results
        - can use templates for regularly used spreadsheet models (come pre-build & pre-installed)
        - data can be imported easily from a database
        - data can be entered more accurately due to computer based validation & verification 
    - disadvantages
        - cannot account for every possible change
        - cannot model the exact values
            - eg: how much people think they will save
        - cannot predict what will happen incase of a financial crisis
        - need to consider many variables
        - some situations will need purpose-built software
            - and expert knowledge
            - so, its expensive to buy

### for Other Stuff

- payroll processing
    - spreadsheets vs database
        - spreadsheets  
            - advantages
                - easier to create complex formulae in spreadsheets
                    - for calculating net wages
                        - after tax
                        - insurance
                        - pension numbers
                - easier to use functions like COUNTIF
                    - to count the number meeting a specific condtion
                - charts are easier to produce
                - repeated data is easy to enter
                - easier to model scenarios
                    - eg: future wage expenditure  
            - disadvantages
        - database
            - advantages
                - fields are easier to name and query
                    - eg: name, address, rate of pay, wages
                - can use complex filters/queries
                - eg:
                    - workers in specific department
                    - earning a specific amount or more
                - queries can be saved and used/updated later
                    - using database management software
                - can only create relational databases
                    - to relate workers to payroll
            - disadvantages
                - hard to create calculated fields
                - 

## Formula

- user created
- can be simple or complex, as user wants
- may contain functions
    - can also write without using any functions
- eg: `=A3-C3` is a formula

## Functions

- provided by spreadsheet software
- a function is also a formula,
    - but, parts have been pre-defined by the computer software
- most functions have a criteria
    - but not all
    - eg: RAND(...)
- eg: `=AVERAGE(A1:A9)` is a function

## Formula vs Functions

- representations of mathematic operations
- can involve use of cell references within them
- not visible in csv format

## Graphs & Charts

### Bar Chart

- has x-axis and y-axis
- viewers can see comparisons by comparing line height
- to represent company profits in a quarter
    - heigh of bar: how much money
    - x axis: category axis

### Line Chart

- can emphasize trends over time
- allows viewer to trace it backwards
- to represent company profits for all four quarters
    - money value against year
    - joined together by (straight) lines
