## Monitoring

### Uses

- Weather Stations
    - sensors are used to feed data back to computer
        - sesnors gather: humidity, temperature, rainfall, etc...
    - analgue data is converted to digital form for processing using ADC
    - compurter stores readings in a table
        - ready to be processed
        - plots graphs automatically
    - calculates minimum and maximum temperature
    - outputs graphs on screen

- CCTV monitoring
    - advantages
        - will monitor constantly
        - so, will keep criminals away
        - makes employees less likely to steal
        - if a crime occurs, CCTV fotage can be used as evidence
        - if conflict among employees, boss can decide what actions to take by watching footage
        - disputes with customer and employee, can share blame with this footage
    - disadvantages
        - not able to display every bit of an area
        - invasion of privacy
        - employees may feel uncomfortable
        - hackers can get into the system
            - and see everything
            - and delete footage of crimes commited

- Monitor Workplace
    - advantages (emloyer) 
        - software expensive to purcahse
        - system expensive to set up
        - can lend to lawsuits for piracy infringement
        - mistrusting employees creates trust issues
    - advantages (employee) 
        - video monitoring gaurantees their security
        - provides detailed view of what employees are doing
            - weather they are following orders, etc...
    - disadvantages (employee) 
        - allows employers to monitor without employees knowing
        - but, some employers do not notify employees
            - they secretly monitor (so, bad)

- Monitoring Pollution

## Control Systems

### Uses

- car park barrie
    - (with micro-controllers)
    - pressure sensor / induction loop in driveway
    - sends signal to processor
    - ADC converts analogue signal to digital signal for microprocessor to process
    - microprocessor compares input with pre-set value
    - if its greater,
        - send signal to actuator
        - which raises the barrier
    - light sensor detects break in laser
    - when beam of light resumeds,
        - actuators activated again
        - lowring the barrier

- in bussinesses
    - computer controlled production lines
        - increase unemployment
    - computer controlled printing presses 
        - replace printing workers
    - IT technicians needed to maintain these infrastructure
    - number of new jobs are less than jobs lost

-  in homes
    - microcontrolled devices can be used to do small tasks, saving time
    - burglar alarms can be used
    - can lead to people becoming lazy
    - loss of household skills (due to use of microcontrolled devices)

- traffic lights
    - fewer traffic jam than manually controlled
    - input devices
        - induction loop
            - when a vehicle goes over it
            - the computer will get a signal
        - sound sensor
            - kerb stones constantly feeding back to computer sound level
            - if noise above set value limit, 
                - it means a vehicle has passed it
        - video camera
            - fixed above traffic lights
            - registers approaching vehicles
            - and sends to computer
        - push buttons
            - when predestrian presses a button
            - signal goes to computer
            - to register a pedestrian is waiting to cross
    
- street light
    - more economical
    - turns on/off automatically

- Air Conditioning in stores
    - increases costs of store
    - so, prices to the customer

## Input

- MICR
    - magnetic ink character recognition
    - advantages
        - characters are readable even if document is overprinted
        - high security
            - since they are difficult to forge
        - error rate reading them is small
    - disadvnatages
        - more demanging printing process
        - has difficult-to-achieve standards
        - causes a slower print
        - readers are expensive to purchase
        - recognizes fronts written in specific format only
        - MICR printer catridges are much more expensive
- OCR
    - optical character recognition
    - advantages
        - faster than entering large amount of text
        - cheapter than paying someone to enter text
        - allows documents to be made editable
    - disadvnatages
        - all documents should be checked manually and carefully
        - as its not 100% accurate
            - has errors:
                - 'm' instead of 'rn'
                - '0' instead of 'O'

- OMR
    - optical mark recognition
    - advantages
        - used in exams
        - easier for students to complete
        - essential candidate details can be pre-printed
        - faster to mark scripts
        - more accurate marking of scripts
        - statistics are more easily produced
    - disadvnatages
        - cannot express themselves easily
        - answers are not easily human readable
        - questions cannot be open ended
        - equipment is more expensive to purchase
