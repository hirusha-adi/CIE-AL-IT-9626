## Models

- create models before building them in real life
- we create models to run [simulations](#simulations)

- advantages
    - can test all aspects without damaging expensive hardware
    - can prodive results that are generally not measurable in some experiments
    - can allow you to see how a system might respond
        - can test and modify to avoid real mistakes
    - cheaper as no need to make different prototypes to test them out
    - safer when testing nuclear models
    - designing in computer saves time
    - gives accurate predictions of results
    - critical situations can be executed 
        - without risk
        - more quickly
    - models can be slowed down to study more closely & carefully  
    - we can ask many "what if?" questions

    - testing desings with computer is more safe
    - testing like this is cheap
    - can obtain results soon
        - even actions that take a long time in real life
    - re-designing computer models is cheaper
    - researches will have tools to simulate scenarios
        - that are hard to observe in operating reactors    

- disadvantages
    - expensive to buy modelling software
    - sometimes, data might be insufficient
    - simulator response is not exactly the same
        - as there are too many variables
    - requires fast computer system
        - with fast processor
        - and large amounts of storage
    - a quick event might take hours to imitate in a simulated environment
    - reduction of simulation, based on oversimplification of assumption
    - users might be given a false sense of security

    - researches need extra knowledge in setting the simulation up
        - need specialist knowledge (eg: of mechanical engineering)
        - most researches only specialize in one field
            - they need to learn another field
            - which costs money
    - cannot exactly re-create
    - not every variable is included in the model
    - leading to incaccurate results  
    - specialist knowledge required to build the model


### Spreadsheets

- For creating financial models, why use spreadsheets?
    - absolute and relative cell referencing
        - can only deals with data we want to
        - allows to change indidual items to see effect
    - cell protection   
        - makes sure the cell doesnt get deleted by accident
        - for fixed data/costs, eg: overhead
    - user interface forms
        - easier to input data to model
    - macros
        - easier to make more complex functions
        - eg: comparing different data/costs simultaneously
    - automatic re-calculation
        - dont need to evaluvate formula everytime we change it
        - formulas can be re-calculated automatically
        - eg: changing indiviual data/costs
    - conditional formatting
        - allows to highlight values
        - that match given criteria
        - easily seeing what makes profit
    - goalseek
        - to know which variables to change
        - to reach goal
    - values can be changed to ask what if questions
    - how many good need to be sold
    - graphs 
        - to show trends
        - and illustrate forecasts
        - eg: of which are likely to make profits
    - producing an effective model maybe time consuming
    - the might have repeated formulae
    - complex predictions may need third party software / modules
        - which are expensive to buy
    - data can be entered accurately using validation and verification 

## Simulations

- nuclear reactions
    - advantages
        - avoids safety problems, eg:
            - nuclear meltdowns
            - environmental problems
        - testing nuclear reactions using computer models cut costs
            - dont have to pay for meterials
            - eg: uranium
        - results can be obtained in a short period of time
            - when actual reactions might take a long time
        - re-designing the model is cheaper than re-creating a nuclear reaction
        - can be designed to allow extreme conditions  
    - disadvantages
        - cant always re-create exact real world experiment
        - not all variables can be inlcuded
            - so, inaccurate results
        - costs money to hire computer experts to create the models 


- pilots using flight simulators
    - how they work
        - simulates difficult scenarios
        - need specialised equipment
            - costs a lot
            - eg: pilot seat, joystick, throttle, alititude gauges, etc...
        - need specialised software
            - has rules of model
            - that defines how the simultation works
            - includes database about information/map of all airpots
        - control panel and cockpit mimicks a real one
        - displays generated by computer 
        - computer graphics produce display using 
            - projectors
            - panoramic spherical mirrors 
    - advantages
        - cheaper cuz no expenses for aircraft maintenance
            - no fuel costs, 
            - no insurance costs, etc...
            - maintaining simulator is much cheaper 
        - no pollution (air/noise)
        - doesnt put trainee, instructor & flight in danger
        - no cost to replace parts (incase of an accident)
        - emergency situations can be re-created quickly & easily
        - less time wasted travelling
        - low level of noise
            - makes communication between instructor & trainee easier  
    - disadvantages
        - simulator response is not same an actual airplane
        - as there are too many variables
        - some pilots will be overconfident, and will mess up actual driving
        - pilots may be more stressed when riding real plane
        - length of training session is shorter
            - might be more tired in real flights

- weather forecasting (predctions)
    - involves several weather forecasters
    - and days of calculations
    - today, one model can handle the task
    - models used to predict future patterns
    - computer models can help make relaibale predictions
    - can be used to predict future patterns of weather
    - more complex models make more accurate predictions
    - human forecasters still need to evaluvate the results
    - requires the use of a lot of data
    - must consider many variable to be effective & accurate
        - atmospheric pressure
        - humidity
        - rainfall
        - temperature
        - wind speed and direction
    - a lot of processing power is needed
        - so, super computers have to be used
    - models can compare current conditions with previous similar trends shown over the time. 

- teaching to drive
    - advantages
        - can teach without worrying about damage to expensive car
        - can provide variables hard to measure
            - eg: reaction time of driver
        - can allow you to see how a system might respond
            - before you design or modify it
            - avoiding mistakes
        - safer to use a model to simulate cards
            - safer for driver/instructor/passengers/pedestrians
        - can be slowed down to study behaviour
        - easier to simulate critical event
            - rather than waiting for it to happen
            - eg: different driving conditions 
    - disadvantages
        - insufficient data to produce mathematical models
        - sometimes impossible to create accurate models
            - eg: effects of human behaviour
        - formulae and functions used may not be accurate
        - may give drivers a false sense of security when driving  

- safety drill about evacuvating people off a building
    - advantages
        - no need to stop working of large number of workers
        - leading to lack of productivity during that time
        - no risk of stempedes occuring
            - so, no risk of injuries
        - emergency procedures can be quickly produced / re-created
        - less time wasted training people to unwanted drills
        - no. of people in trial may not be representative
    - disadvantages
        - there may be too many variables
        - to exactly simulate the evacuation
        - high costs of employing experts to create the simulation
        - time taken to create simulation is higher
        - difficult to accurately predict
            - the exit doors chosen by each individual
