### Codecs

- how video codecs are used?
    - short form of coder-decoder 
    - used to encode/decode digital data stream
    - used to compress data to reduce transmission bandwidth
    - the decoder reverses the encoding for playback
    - there are many different types of codecs
    - without codecs, downloads will take very long
    - its common to need 10-12 codes to play users's media

- features
    - to reduce the file size of audio and video files
    - type of encoding
    - encoded media is similar is quiality, but smaller in size
    - can also be lossy
        - (just the lossy & lossless compression parts) 
        - lacks information present in original video
        - decompressed video has lower quiality now
        - not enough information to accurately re-construct the original media
    - each media file has a codec program
    - codec
        - used to encode 
            - into appropriate format
            - changes original data into a form
            - that can be used by external processes
        - decodes for playback
    - (en)/(de)coding usually refers to process of ADC and DAC
    - can apply to images/audio/video/signals-from-sensors/control-systems

## Audio Editing (Software)

### Audio Files

- samples
    - digital audio is a series of discrete bursts
    - frequency of samples stored is high
    - so it sounds continous

- sampling rate
    - number of samples in a given period of time
        - high sampling rate = high quality = high storage usage
        - low sampling rate = low quality = low storage usage -> leads to distortion
        - since less gaps between each sample
        - sounds more continous
    - theres also a minimum rate at which samples need to be taken
        - to reproduce original sound
    - question
        - what is sampling resolution and how it affects the audio quality
            - number of bits per sound sample
            - maximum accuracy of each measurement taken of a wave form when creating an audio file
            - high = more accuracy = more file size
                - when converting from analogue to digital
            - digital audio is usually uses 8-bit / 16-bit resolutions
            - 8-bit resolution was used in earliest sound cards
                - and old recordings
                - each sample can take one of 256 different values
                - not enough
            - 16-bit
                - standard for CD drives and new sound cards  
                - each sample can take one of 65536 different values
                - good quality
            - these values are all per channel
            - in stereo, two channels are used (Left & Right)
                - doubles the sampling and memmory requirement

- sampling resolution
    - no. of bits used to carry data in each sample of sound
        - high sampling resolution = high quality = high storage usage
        - low sampling resolution = low quality = low storage usage
        - since less number of bits used to store each sample
        - usually, its 8-bits or 16-bits / 64-bits or 128-bits
    - explanation:
        - for example, if sample resolution is 8-bits,
        - each sample can have 256 values

- stero sound
    - usually, sound has only one channel (mono)
    - for stereo, you need to have two tracks
    - Left and Right


### Features

- trimming
    - cuts part of sound
    - reducing the length of track
    - enables unwanted sounds to be removed

- adjusting sampling rate
    - increase
        - to improve sound quality
    - decrease
        - to save disk space 

- adjusting sampling resolution
    - increase
        - to improve sound quality
    - decrease
        - to save disk space 

- fading
    - fading in
        - occurs at beginning of sound clip
        - sound gradually gets louder
        - volume stops increasing when required sound level is reached
        - uses
            - can use when there is a clear section
                - of silence before track starts
            - to soften introduction of sound at start
    - fading out
        - occurs at end of sound clip
        - sound gradually gets softer
        - sound disappears all together
        - uses
            - can use when audio has no obvious ending


## Video Editing (Software)

### Features

        - double click in the "title" frame
            - in the preview window

        - how to add caption?
            - click on frame (at required position)
            - select "Text Box" / "Caption"
            - type the text
        - to provide additional information for viewers (for a better understanding)
        - accessiblity for deaf people
        - what has been said is shown on the screen
            - can be read
            - so, nothing is missed
        - if language used is foreign
        - to watch without audio, 
            - eg: in pubic
            - in quite area
