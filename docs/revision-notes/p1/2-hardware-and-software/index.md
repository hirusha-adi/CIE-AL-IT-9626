## Computers

### Mainframe Computers

- why used to produce census?
    - mainframes has a,
        - high speed of processing data
        - scalable
        - reliable 
    - amount of data to be processed is very large
    - as countries have a lot of people
        - it also keeps on increasing
        - census processes & produces more data
    - more poweful machines are needed as more data is added


### Super Computers

### Characteristics

- fault tolerance
    - both
        - whether computer will repair itself if an error occurs
        - a computer can operate even if components fail
        - without system downtime
        - computers operating quality can be reduce
            - but it does not fail completely
        - whether when a hardware component fails, is it hot swappable
    - super computer only
        - will run two copies of software
        - if one fails, the second copy will start

- heat maintainance
    - computers generate a lot of heat
        - due to quality and quantity of processors
    - it can be a problem when it overheats
    - to address this issue
        - good cooling systems are needed
            - can air cool with an AC - expensive
            - can water cool - cheap, efficient
            - build datacenter in a cold part of the world, eg: greenland.

## System Software

### Compilers

- features
    - translates the whole porgram as one complete unit
    - creates an executable file
    - is able to report on a number of errors in the code after compilation
    - does not need to be present in order to run the program (compiled executable)
    - can optimize source code to run as fast or as efficiently as possible

### Interpreters

- features
    - translates each line of source code inito an intermediate stage and then executes that line / statment
    - reports on errors as lines of source code are enetered
    - only a few lines of source code needs to be in memory at any one time
    - some interpreters execute code within a virtual machine
    - these have been designed to disallow code from directly accessing the data computer

### Linkers

### Operating systems

### Device drivers

## Utility Software

### Anti Virus Software

- scans computer for viruses
- software used to prevent, detect and remove malicious software (called 'malware' for short)
- can protect from: 
    - malicious browser helper objects, 
    - browser hijackers, 
    - ransomware, 
    - keyloggers,
    - backdoors,
    - rootkits,
    - trojan horses,
    - worms,
    - adware,
    - spyware, 
    - etc...
- signature based detection
    - compares the contents of  file
    - to its database of known signatures
- heuristic-based detection
    - detects malware vased on characteristics typically used in known malware code
- behavourial based detection
    - based on behavourial fingerprint of the malware at runtime
    - is only able to detect malware after they have start malicous actions
- sandbox detection
    - based on behavourial detection
    - but it doesnt detect behavourial at runtime
    - it executes the programs in a virtual environment
        - logging the actions performed by the file
- gives the user options to delete or qurantine the files

### Data Compression

- encoding information using fewer bits than the original representation
- two types
    - lossless compression
        - reduces the number of bits
            - by identifying repeated patterns
            - and encoding them in special ways
                - eg: Run Length Encoding (RLE), Huffman Encoding
        - same quality
        - information is not lost
    - lossy compression
        - reduces the number of bits 
            - by identifying unncecessary information
            - and removing them
        - reduced quality 
        - information is lost
    

### Disk Defragmentation

- organizes contents of the disk into smallest number of contiguous blocks
- attempts to create larger regions of free space using compaction
- some defragmentation utilities try to keep smaller files within a single directory together
- the movement of the hard drive's read/write heads over different areas of the disk when accessing fragmented files is slower
    - compared to accessing the entire contents of a non-fragmented file sequentially


### Disk Formatting

- prepares a data storage device for initial use
- organizes the tracks on a disk into sectors
- a new disk medium is fully prepared in order to store files
- the first stage is low-level formatting followed by
    - partitioning which makes the data storage device visible to an OS
    - followed by high-level formatting which generated a new file system

## Software

### Off the Shelf


### Custom Written

- what
    - software created for defined purposes
    - does not need to be adapted for use
    - any built in settings can be changed
    - programmer will ensure device compatibility
    - if software doesnt meet companies requirements
        - programmers with have everything fixed
        - eg: ability to copy software to several devices
    - they will not have unncecessary bloated features
        - the usually takes less space than off the shelf software
            - so, less expensive storage costs
    - *company will own the custom written software, so, they can sell it to others*


## User Interfaces

- CLI & GUI
    - more accurate

- GBI & Dialog Interface
    - for handicapped users who cannot use keyboard and mouse
        - or control their limbs accurately
    - more expensive to develop
    - for reasons of hygene, not even a doctor is allowed to touch the device
        - then, use gestures or dialog to control device

### CLI

- Command Line Interface

### GUI

- Graphical User Interface

### Dialog Interface

- Dialog Interface
- stuff?
    - can speak into a microphone to control the device
    - requires training session with user
    - unreliable when there is a background noise
    - gives hands free control
        - can use when driving, can use voice instead of driving with one hand

### GBI

- Gesture-Based Interface
- stuff?
    - can perform a gesture to control the device
    - quicker way of initating a response from a device
    - less effective when several users or with background movement
    - gestures can be taught through manuals
    - unreliable when used in the dark
    - bad when driving, will have to drive with one hand while doing gestures with the other hand
    - unintentional gestures might be registered


## File Types (to Database)

- **NOTE: THIS BELONGS TO THE 'DATABASE' PART OF P1**

- why use text file (generic file format) instead of using word processed file? 
    - file size is smaller
        - takes less storage space
    - text format doesnt need to buy license / software
        - eg: of word processing software
    - can be opened by more applications
    - data can be exchanged among different OS / Computers
    - word processing software has many versions
        - one may not support documents made with another verison
