Text for MouseOver display
Science:	Our Science faculty rates as one of the best in the world. Our award-winning staff include a Nobel prize winner and 2 winners of the prestigious Norma Dent Prize. With state-of-the-art equipment, including our own ‘Collider’, our research facilities are second to none.
Computer Science:	Our Computer facilities and resources are world beating. Students have full access to a network of innovative Quantum computers and can investigate all the answers to everything in the Universe. 
Engineering:	Our Engineering faculty is a world leader in the search for a perpetual motion machine and the generation of free energy. Recently we have received universal acclaim for improvements to the design of the wheel.
