With two months left until the exam, I've just started my preparations.

A bad experience with a teacher convinced me that self-learning is the best approach for me. The four hours with that teacher were unproductive, showing that self-guided learning can be more effective.

My plan is to finish my exam preparation in two months. I'll share all the resources I create and find online through this website. These resources will be available until my exams are over, and I might offer everything for $5 afterward.

Stay tuned for updates and resources as I work through this journey.
