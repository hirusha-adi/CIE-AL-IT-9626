## Question Analysis

File Handling will be referred to as "FH"

```
Specimen Paper 4:
- Arrays: insertion sort
- OOP
- Queue (with FH): anqueue

2021 June 41, 2021 June 42, 2021 June 43:
- Linked list: add Node, output Node
- Array: linear search, bubble sort
- OOP (with FH)

2021 Nov 41, 2022 Nov 42, 2022 Nov 43:
- Arrays: werid recursive to iterative (no idea what that code does exactly)
- OOP (with FH)
- Binary tree (with arrays): add node, print all, in order traversal

2022 June 41, 2022 June 43:
- Arrays (with FH): basics
- OOP
- Circular Queue: enqueue, dequeue 

2022 June 42:

- 2D Array: bubble sort, binary search
- OOP (with FH)

2022 Nov 41, 2022 Nov 43:

- OOP (with FH)
- Queue: enqueue, iterative output

2023 June 41, 2023 June 43: 
- Array (with FH): linear search
- OOP
- Stack: push, pop

2023 June 42:

```

## Guesses

- Below are three guesses at "2022 June 42":

### Guess 1

1. **Data Structure: Stack**
   - **Push and Pop Operations:** The stack operations (push and pop) have appeared frequently in the past exams, and particularly in Paper 42 of previous years like 2022 June 42 and 2023 Nov 42. Hence, it is likely to appear again.

2. **2D Array**
   - **Sorting and Searching Operations:** Previous exams have shown a pattern where 2D arrays were tested with sorting and searching algorithms, such as bubble sort and binary search in 2022 June 42 and insertion sort in 2022 Nov 42. Given this trend, it's probable that 2D arrays will appear with some form of sorting or searching operation.

3. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
   - **With File Handling:** OOP has consistently appeared in all the papers you listed, often combined with file handling (FH). Considering its regular inclusion, it is highly likely to be a part of the exam again.

Given these trends, the three likely topics for the "2024 June 42" paper are:

1. **Stack:** Focus on fundamental operations such as push and pop, possibly involving some additional operations or problem-solving using a stack.
2. **2D Array:** Likely to include operations such as sorting (e.g., bubble sort or insertion sort) and searching (e.g., linear search or binary search).
3. **OOP (with File Handling):** Expect questions on designing classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and possibly integrating file handling within the OOP context.

These topics align with the observed patterns from previous exams and cover a broad range of fundamental concepts likely to be tested.

### Guess 2

1. **Queue**
   - **Enqueue and Dequeue Operations:** Queue operations, particularly enqueue and dequeue, have appeared in previous papers like 2022 June 43 and 2023 Nov 41. This makes it a strong candidate for appearing again, possibly in a circular queue context or a standard linear queue.

2. **1D Array**
   - **Sorting or Searching:** Given the frequent appearance of array operations, we might see either a bubble sort, insertion sort, or a linear search operation. For instance, bubble sort has been tested multiple times, including 2022 June 42 and 2023 June 42.

3. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
   - **With File Handling:** Consistently included in nearly all papers, OOP concepts coupled with file handling are likely to appear again. This could involve class design, inheritance, polymorphism, or working with files within an OOP framework.

### Guess 3

1. **Binary Tree (with Arrays)**
   - **Node Operations and Traversals:** Binary tree operations such as adding nodes, searching, and traversing (in-order, post-order) have been tested in several papers, including 2021 Nov 41 and 2022 Nov 43. This makes it a likely topic, with a focus on implementing these operations using arrays.

2. **2D Array**
   - **Binary Search or Bubble Sort:** 2D arrays with sorting and searching operations have appeared previously (e.g., bubble sort in 2022 June 42, binary search in 2022 June 42). These types of questions are fundamental and are likely to be tested again.

3. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
   - **With File Handling:** Given its ubiquity across all examined papers, OOP with file handling is highly likely to appear again. This could involve designing a system that incorporates file reading/writing within an OOP structure.
