My journey and resources (including notes) that I used to pass CIE A/L Information Technology within 3 months. I've also shared my journey in the blog section of this site. You can access everything inside [it.hirusha.xyz](https://it.hirusha.xyz). If you want to run it locally, just git clone, npm install dependencies and npm run start. This is a very basic and minimally customized docusaurus site. The past papers also includes some answers that I found to be cool and interesting, such as missive microsoft excel formulas.
