Hello Jekyllers!

This is a very small release containing two things:

 - A fix for using Jekyll with Ruby 3.3 and the new `logger` gem included with that release.
 - A test fix for newer versions of Ruby for packagers that run the test suite
 as part of their packaging process.

Nothing new in the way of features for this release. You'll need to wait for v4.4 for that. ðŸ˜„

Happy Jekylling!!
