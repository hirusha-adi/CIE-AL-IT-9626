## Activity 1a

**Explain the difference between data and information.**

| Feature             | Data                                   | Information                              |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**      | Raw facts, figures, symbols            | Processed, organized data with context   |
| **Nature**          | Unprocessed                            | Processed                                |
| **Meaning**         | No inherent meaning                    | Meaningful and useful                    |
| **Purpose**         | Foundation for information             | Used for decision-making, understanding  |
| **Characteristics** | Raw, objective, lacks context          | Processed, contextual, provides insights |
| **Examples**        | Temperature readings, survey responses | Weather forecasts, performance reports   |
| **Usage**           | Initial collection                     | Decision-making, knowledge creation      |

<h3>Data:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Definition:</strong> Data refers to raw facts, figures, or symbols that have no meaning by themselves. It is typically in the form of numbers, text, images, sounds, etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Characteristics:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Raw:</strong> Data is unprocessed and lacks context or interpretation.</li>
      <li><strong>Objective:</strong> It is objective and does not imply any meaning or relevance on its own.</li>
      <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Examples of data include temperature readings, student IDs, survey responses in their raw form.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Information:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Definition:</strong> Information is data that has been processed, organized, structured, or presented in a given context to make it meaningful, useful, and relevant.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Characteristics:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Processed:</strong> Information results from the processing or analysis of data to extract meaning.</li>
      <li><strong>Contextual:</strong> It is contextual and provides insights or knowledge that can be used for decision-making.</li>
      <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Examples of information include weather forecasts derived from temperature data, student performance reports generated from student IDs and grades, conclusions drawn from survey responses.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Key Differences:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Nature:</strong> Data is raw and unprocessed, while information is processed and meaningful.</li>
  <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> Data is collected without any specific purpose initially, whereas information is processed data intended to be useful.</li>
  <li><strong>Context:</strong> Data lacks context and needs interpretation, whereas information is contextualized and ready for use in decision-making or understanding.</li>
  <li><strong>Usage:</strong> Data serves as the foundation for generating information, which in turn helps in making informed decisions.</li>
</ul>
