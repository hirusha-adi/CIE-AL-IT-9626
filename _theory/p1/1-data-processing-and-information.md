## Data and Information

-   data:

    -   'raw data' has no meaning
    -   eg: characters, symbols, images, audio clips, video clips and so on, _none of which, on their own, have any meaning_
    -   eg: 110053, 641609, 160012 (these are just some set of numbers with no meaning)

-   information:
    -   data that has been given meaning
    -   computers process data and make it information
    -   eg: 110053, 641609, 160012 are some postal codes in India (data is give meaning here)

### Data processing

-   data stored as bits (binary digits)
-   input (data) -> stored -> processed -> output (information)
-   eg: parity checks, etc..

### Direct Data

#### Description

-   aka "original data"
-   description
    -   data collected for an specific purpose

#### Sources

-   Questionnaires
    -   set of questions on specific issue
    -   types:
        1. Closed questions - choose from given answers
        2. Open questions - can write our own answers (in detail)
-   Interviews
    -   formal
    -   interviewer asks questions, interviewee replies
    -   types:
        1. Structured interviews:
            - same for everyone
            - select from given set of answers
        2. Unstructured interviews:
            - different for each person
            - give any answer
-   Observation
    -   data collectors watch the situation
    -   collects information of seeing whats happening rather than directly asking
-   Data logging
    -   input (sensors - 1 or more) -> analyzed -> output (graphs)
    -   collected for a period of time, with regular intervals
    -   used in scientific experiments (when need to collect faster than humans can)
    -   measures: temperatures, sound frequencies, light intensities, electrical currents, and pressure

#### Uses

-   eg: planning a bus route
    -   data collection
        -   where people prefer to have the bus stops (Questionnaires)
        -   walking times to the bus stop for everyone (Observation, Interviews)
        -   potential passengers who would use the new route (Interviews)
        -   Number of passengers using that route (Data Loggers)

### Indirect Data

#### Description

-   obtained from a third party
-   and used for a different purpose than the original
-   eg:
    -   electoral registers,
    -   data brokers: businesses collecting personal information for use by other organizations

#### Sources
